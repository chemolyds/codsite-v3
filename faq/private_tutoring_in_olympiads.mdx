title: Should I hire a private tutor?
---

Over the last ten years, private tutoring has become popular within the Chemistry Olympiad scene. While tutoring can be effective, we also encourage you to try preparing for the exam alone.

Here are some things to consider:

1. Private tutors won't provide you with secrets; they primarily help you digest the content. Most of the information provided by a tutor can also be found in a textbook or on this website.
2. Most Olympiad-specific tutors run on a lecture/problem set series. This doesn't allow for any flexibility on when you want to study Chemistry.
3. A multitude of IChO Medalists and campers did not use tutoring. At the end of the day, tutoring is just another tool. The tools does not make you a camper, your actions do!
