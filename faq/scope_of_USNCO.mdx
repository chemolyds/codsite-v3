title: What is covered by US National Exam?
---

The scope of the US National test for both the Locals Exam and the Nationals Part I Exam is as follows. Any test before 2012 does not follow this format, and therefore not recommended to use them as practice material.

**Stoichiometry/Solutions** (6 questions): Knowledge of your first-year high school general chemistry.

**Descriptive Chemistry** (3~5 questions): Flame tests, ion colors, selective precipitation, and trivial chemistry.

**Laboratory** (1~3 questions): Human errors, procedures, and lab equipment knowledge.

**States of Matter** (6 questions): Three types of matter, phase changes, phase diagrams, IMFs, vapor pressure.

**Thermodynamics** (6 questions): Thermocycles, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Although most questions are calculations, there have always been at least one theoretical question.

**Kinetics** (6 questions): Half-life, elementary reactions (including pre-equilibrium and SSA), integrated rate laws, energy diagrams, and reaction rates.

**Equilibrium** (6 questions): Chemical equilibrium (including solubility and acid-base chemistry).

**Redox/Electrochemistry** (6 questions): Redox reactions and electrochemistry.

**Atoms** (6 questions): Atomic theory and periodicity.

**Molecules** (6 questions): Bonding and molecular structure.

**Organic Chemistry** (5 questions): All of the questions can be answered with Kleins' Organic Chemistry.

**Biochemistry** (1 questions): There is always one biochemistry question, but it's probably not worth your time to study it.

The Part II Exam contains topics similar to Part I, but the concepts are often combined. Biochemistry and Laboratory topics are never included in Part II.
