The Ti-36X calculator meets the criteria for all levels of Chemistry Olympiads and has the most functionality of other calculators. It also has built-in constants and better buttons than comparable Texas Instruments calculators.

Note that the Ti-84 or any other graphing calculator is prohibited in Chemistry Olympiads.
