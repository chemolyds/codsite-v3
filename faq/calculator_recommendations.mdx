title: What calculator should I use?
---

We recommend the Ti-36X calculator, because it meets the criteria for all levels of Chemistry Olympiads and has the most functionality. It has constants built-in (that you use rather often) and has decent buttons compared to other scientific calculators made by Texas Instruments. 

Note that the Ti-84 or any other graphing calculator is prohibited in Chemistry Olympiads.
