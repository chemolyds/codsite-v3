title: Should I read Atkins?
---

Unlike academic Chemistry, where everyone reads at the same pace, competitive Chemistry gives you the freedom to determine your own pace of reading. That being said, you could either take a year to completely read Atkins, or you could finish the entire textbook in less than 2 weeks provided you have a lot of background knowledge of Chemistry.
