## 6.3.1 Introduction

**I** Solubility depends on the relative strength of the interactions between the solvent and the solute

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    if solvent-solute interactions are comparable (equal or stronger) than
    between each type of molecule separately, the solute dissolves in the
    solvent
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        like-dissolves-like: solvents that can mimic the cohesive forces of the
        solute- solute interactions are good for dissolving the solute
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    if solvent-solute interactions are not comparable (weaker) than between each
    type of molecule separately, the solute does not dissolve in the solvent
  </li>
  <li>
    agitation such as shaking and stirring increases the rate of process, but
    does not increase the amount of solute dissolved
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        new solvent molecules are continuously introduced with agitation, and
        therefore allows for new interactions much faster
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    saturated: when the solvent has dissolved all the solute it possibly can
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        when a solution is saturated, the rate of the forward and reverse
        process is equal
      </li>
      <li>molar solubility (s): molar concentration of a saturated solution</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**II** Henry's Law: the solubility of a gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $\textrm{k}_{H}$ is henry's constant and is dependent on the gas, the solvent, and temperature
  </li>
  <li>
    as pressure increases, the rate at which the gas molecules strike the surface of the liquid increases

    $\textrm{s} = \textrm{k}_{H} \textrm{P}$ (Eq. 103)

  </li>
</ol>

**III** If the temperature increases, all solutes dissolve faster in a solvent

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    however, this does not mean that solubility is increased with temperature
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        most gases become more insoluble with increasing temperature as their
        kinetic energy increases and can escape much more easily
      </li>
      <li>
        extensively hydrated solids such as lithium carbonate (small size and
        high polarizing power) decrease solubility with increasing temperature
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 6.3.2 Thermodynamics of Stability

**IV** enthalpy of solution ($\Delta \textrm{H}_{sol}$): the change in molar enthalpy when a substance dissolve

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    limiting enthalpy of solution: $\Delta \textrm{H}_{sol}$ in dilute solutions
    where solute-solute interactions are negligible
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        this function is used more frequently when measuring $\Delta \textrm{H}$
        calorimetrically to isolate solute-solvent interactions
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    $\Delta \textrm{H}_{sol}$ can be calculated with two hypothetical steps:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the lattice enthalpy ($\Delta \textrm{H}_{L}$): the change in enthalpy
        resulting from the separation of the ionic solid into gaseous ions
      </li>
      <li>
        the enthalpy of hydration ($\Delta \textrm{H}_{hyd}$): the change in
        enthalpy resulting from the hydration gaseous ions
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the addition of these two hypothetical steps result in the value of $\Delta
    \textrm{H}_{sol}$.
  </li>
</ol>

**V** prediction solubility is difficult because there are many factors that determine it

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    most substances with a negative $\Delta \textrm{H}_{sol}$ tend to be
    soluble, as long as $\Delta \textrm{G}_{sol} \lt 0$
  </li>
  <li>
    although the entropy of the system typically increases as a solute is
    dissolved, there are some clear exceptions:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>when the solute is a gas, the entropy will most likely decrease.</li>
      <li>
        solvents with cage-like structures that capture the solute molecules
        such as EDTA, cryptands, and crown ethers also decrease entropy.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>both enthalpy of hydration and lattice enthalpy share common factors</li>
</ol>

## 6.3.3 Colloids

**VI** colloids: the dispersion of small particles in a solvent, a heterogenous mixture

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the solute particles are too small to be observed directly, but too big for
    light to pass through
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Tyndall effect: the dispersion of light in colloids</li>
      <li>
        milk is opaque due to the Tyndall effect and the fact that it is a
        colloid
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    there are many types of colloids, depending on the dispersed phase and
    medium
  </li>
  <li>
    many precipitates (insoluble ionic compounds that come out of solution) form
    initially as colloidal suspensions
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Brownian motion: the random motion of particles due to constant
        collision with the fluid
      </li>
      <li>
        Brownian motion causes the precipitates from settling out of the
        solution
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 6.3.4 Concentration

**VII** Three measures of concentration are useful for the study of solutions (J is an example solution):

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    molar concentration (molarity), denoted as $\textrm{c}_{J}$ or [J]
    <ol type="i">
      <li>defined as mole of solute over volume of solution</li>
      <li>affected by temperature</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    mole fraction, denoted as $\textrm{x}_{J}$
  </li>
  <li>
    molality, denoted as $\textrm{b}_{J}$
    <ol type="i">
      <li>defined as mole of solute over kilograms of solvent</li>
      <li>independent of temperature</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** There are some useful conversions you should practice using (and learn how to derive them):

## 6.3.5 Colligative Properties

**IX** colligative properties: properties that only depend on the relative amounts of solute and solvent

<ol type="a">
  <li>independent of the solute and solventâ€™s chemical properties;</li>
  <li>
    there are three colligative properties that will be covered in this section:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>boiling-point elevation</li>
      <li>freezing-point depression</li>
      <li>osmosis</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**X** boiling-point elevation: the raising of boiling point due to presence of solute

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the vapor pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of solute;
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        requires a higher temperature for the solution to match the external
        pressure
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    comparing the molar Gibbs free energies of the liquid and vapor phases,
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        With the assumption that $\textrm{G}_{m} \approx \textrm{H}_{m}$ at low
        temperatures, $\textrm{G}_{m} (\textrm{vapor}) \gt \textrm{G}_{m}
        (\textrm{liquid})$.
      </li>
      <li>
        As $\textrm{S}_{m} (\textrm{vapor}) \gt \textrm{S}_{m} (\textrm{liquid}
        )$, the slope is steeper for the vapor.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the entropy increases with presence of solute in a solvent, $\textrm
        {G}_{m} (\textrm{solvent}) \gt \textrm{G}_{m} (\textrm{solution})$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    there must be a large amount of solute to make a noticeable difference
  </li>
</ol>

**XI** freezing-point depression: the lowering of the freezing point due to presence of solute

$\Delta \textrm{T}_{f} = \textrm{i} \textrm{k}_{j} \textrm{b}$ (Eq. 104)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    a larger depression occurs for a certain molality compared to boiling-point
    elevation
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This is because the difference in entropy between the solid phase and
        liquid phase is not substantial as the gas phase
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    i is known as the van't Hoff factor and is the number of particles released
    from one solute molecule
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        for soluble ionic compounds such as $\textrm{BaCl}_{2}$, i = 3.
      </li>
      <li>
        for insoluble or covalent compounds that don't dissociate in solvent, i
        = 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        for weak acids or slightly soluble ionic compounds, i is slightly less
        than what is predicted in the case of i.
      </li>
      <li>an accurate value of i must be determined experimentally.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Cryoscopy can be used to determine the molar mass of a solute by measuring
    the depression of $\textrm{T}_{f}$.
  </li>
</ol>

**XII** osmosis: the tendency of solvent to flow through a membrane into a more concentrated solution

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    a semipermeable membrane is used to only permit certain molecules (such as
    solvent) to pass through
  </li>
  <li>
    addition of a solute to solvent lowers $\textrm{G}_{m}$; the pure solvent
    with a higher molar $\textrm{G}_{m}$ tends to flow into the solution
  </li>
  <li>
    osmotic pressure ($\Pi$): the pressure needed to stop the flow of solvent
    into the more concentrated solution
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if both sides exert the same osmotic pressure, the system is in
        equilibrium $\Pi = \textrm{i} \textrm{R} \textrm{T} \textrm{c}$ (Eq.
        105)
      </li>
      <li>
        reverse osmosis: solvent flows away from concentrated solution; occurs
        when the pressure exerted on the solution is greater than $\Pi$.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
