# 6.4 Chemical Equilibrium

---

## 6.4.1 Introduction

**I** Chemical equilibrium: a state at which the rate of forward and reverse reaction is equal

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A state at which there is no tendency to form products or reactants
  </li>
  <li>
    All equilibria (including chemical equilibria) are dynamic.
  </li>
  <li>
    as reactions proceed, the reverse rate goes up; causing the reaction to “stop”.
  </li>
</ol>

**II** equilibrium constant (K): characteristic of the composition of a mixture at equilibrium

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    equilibrium constants are dependent on the temperature of the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    the equilibrium constant can be calculated by
    $\textrm{K} = \frac{(\textrm{activities of products})^{\textrm{n}_{r}}}{(\textrm{activities of reactants})^{\textrm{n}_{r}}}$ (Eq. 106)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if the substance is a gas, its activity is equal to its partial pressure.
      </li>
      <li>
        if the substance is pure solid or liquid, its activity equals to 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        if the substance is a solution, its activity is approximated by its concentration.
      </li>
      <li>
        all activities are unitless, and therefore the equilibrium constant is also unitless.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**III** reaction quotient (Q): characteristic of the composition of a mixture

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the reaction quotient is also calculated the same way as K (Eq. 106)
  </li>
  <li>
    unlike the equilibrium constant (K), there can be many combinations of Q
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        it is representative of the composition of a certain mixture at a certain time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Q will approach the value of K, until the reaction is at equilibrium where Q = K.
      </li>
      <li>
        this is similar to the case of $\Delta \textrm{G}$ and $\Delta \textrm{G}^{\theta}$.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the reaction quotient can be calculated for any stage of the reaction with $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}$
    $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r} = \Delta \textrm{G}_{r}^{\theta} + \textrm{R} \textrm{T} \textrm{ln}(\textrm{Q})$ (Eq. 107)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r} = 0$, where the system is at equilibrium, this equation can be modified:
        $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}^{\theta} = - \textrm{R} \textrm{T} \textrm{ln}(\textrm{K})$ (Eq. 108)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The composition of the system can be easily determined by looking at $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}^{\theta}$.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}^{\theta} \gt 0$, then $\textrm{K} \lt 1$ and reactants are favored at equilibrium.
      </li>
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}^{\theta} \lt 0$, then $\textrm{K} \gt 1$ and products are favored at equilibrium.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the relationship of the equilibrium constant and $\Delta \textrm{H}$ & $\Delta \textrm{S}$ can also be made:
    $\textrm{ln}(\textrm{K}) = \frac{-\Delta \textrm{H}_{r}^{\theta}}{\textrm{R} \textrm{T}} + \frac{-\Delta \textrm{H}_{r}^{\theta}}{\textrm{R}}$ (Eq. 109)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the relationship of K and temperature is dependent on the change of enthalpy,
        not the change of entropy.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 6.4.2 Equilibrium Calculations

**IV** If a chemical equation is multiplied through by a factor N, then the equilibrium constant is $\textrm{K}_{n}$

**V** If a chemical equation is flipped, then the equilibrium constant is 1/K.

**VI** The equilibrium constant for an overall reaction is the product of the equilibrium constants for its
component reactions.

**VII** To convert between equilibrium constants expressed in partial pressures and in concentrations:

$\textrm{K} = (\textrm{R} \textrm{T})^{\Delta \textrm{n}_{r}} \textrm{K}_{c}$ (Eq. 110)

## 6.4.3 Responses to changes

**VIII** Le Chatelier's principle: when a system in equilibrium is disturbed, the system will adjust to
minimize the disturbance.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    when the amount of a certain reactant or product is adjusted: the value of Q will change,
    and Q will approach the value of K by adjusting other reactants or products.
  </li>
  <li>
    when the pressure of the system is adjusted: if the activities in the reaction quotient
    contain partial pressures, then see how the value of Q changes, and the value of Q will
    approach K by adjusting reactants or products.
  </li>
  <li>
    when the temperature is changed: the van't Hoff equation can be used
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if there are gaseous reactants or products in the reaction, you must use K (in
        partial pressures) instead of $\textrm{K}_{c}$ (in concentration)
      </li>
      <li>
        as described by Eq. 109, the enthalpy of the reaction determines how temperature
        will affect equilibrium

        $\textrm{ln} \frac{\textrm{K}_{2}}{\textrm{K}_{1}} = \frac{\Delta \textrm{H}_{r}^{\theta}}{\textrm{R}} (\frac{1}{\textrm{T}_{1}} - \frac{1}{\textrm{T}_{2}})$ (Eq. 111)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
