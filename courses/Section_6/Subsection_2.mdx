**I** Raoult's Law: the vapor pressure of a liquid is proportional to its mole fraction

$\Rho_{A} = \Chi_{A} \Rho_{A}^{*}$ (Eq. 102)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A limiting law, Raoult's Law becomes increasingly valid as the concentration of one
    component approach zero
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        assumes that there is no heat released from the mixing of the two components; all
        intermolecular interactions are equally strong
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    $\Rho_{A}^{*}$ is the vapor pressure of the pure liquid solvent (when $\Chi_{A} = 1$)
  </li>
  <li>
    Provided Raoult's law is obeyed, a solute will always lower the vapor pressure of a solvent
  </li>
</ol>

**II** The phase diagram for binary liquid mixtures have many variables (temperature, pressure,
composition), and conditions are set to avoid three-dimensional diagrams:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Both components are miscible in all proportions (avoids complex case
    scenarios)
  </li>
  <li>
    The pressure is fixed at 1 atm (sets pressure constant, removes one
    variable)
  </li>
  <li>One the liquid and vapor phases are considered</li>
</ol>

**III** The vapor pressure of the mixture is dependent on composition; the vapor will contain a higher
amount of the more volatile component than the liquid (Raoult's Law and partial pressures)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    As the vapor pressure changes with composition, so does the boiling point
    <ol type="i">
      <li>when vapor pressure equals external pressure, the substance boils</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**IV** distillation: the separation of two components with different boiling points

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    by boiling the mixture and condensing the vapor and repeating this process,
    the distillate becomes richer in the component with the higher vapor
    pressure
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Refer to Figure 75 where as you distill the binary mixture of benzene
        and toluene, the condensed vapor (distillate) becomes richer and richer
        in benzene and the boiling point of the distillate decreases
      </li>
      <li>
        Benzene and toluene differ by one methyl (-CH3) group and are miscible
        at almost all compositions
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**V** Azeotropes: binary mixtures that deviates from Raoult's Law

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    all deviations result from $\Delta \textrm{H}_{mix}$, or the enthalpy of
    mixing
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if interactions between two components are relatively favorable
        (stronger than interactions between each type of molecule separately):
        $\Delta \textrm{H}_{mix} \lt 0$, and results in a positive deviation
      </li>
      <li>
        if interactions between two components are relatively unfavorable
        (weaker than interactions between each type of molecule separately):
        $\Delta \textrm{H}_{mix} \gt 0$, and results in a negative deviation
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    these deviations make perfect distillations impossible (Ref. Figure 76)
  </li>
</ol>
