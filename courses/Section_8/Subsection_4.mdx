# 8.4 Reaction Mechanisms

---

## 8.4.1 Elementary reactions

**I** Elementary reactions: reactions that occur at a molecular level, illustrating the mechanism of the
overall reaction

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    An elementary reaction always deals with molecules, not bulk matter, and therefore do
    not have units attached to them
  </li>
  <li>
    While the coefficients of ordinary chemical reactions tell nothing about the overall
    mechanism, elementary reactions do
  </li>
</ol>

**II** Molecularity: the number of molecules coming together to react in an elementary reaction

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    If the elementary step occurs by n molecules colliding, molecularity is n
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        1 molecule would be unimolecular, 2 molecules would be bimolecular, etc.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Molecularity refers to an individual reaction, order refers to an empirical quantity.
  </li>
</ol>

**III** Kinetic information (rate law) can only support a proposed mechanism; it can never confirm it.

## 8.4.2 Formulation of rate laws

**IV** Intermediate: species that is formed in one elementary reaction and is destroyed in the other

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    An intermediate species must not be present in the overall chemical equation
  </li>
  <li>
    An intermediate species is more likely to be plausible if it is an analogue of a known compound
  </li>
  <li>
    An acceptable rate law must not include intermediates in its final rate law
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This can be avoided by calculating the net rate of formation of the intermediate
        and solving for the concentration of the intermediate
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**V** Rate-determining step (RDS): the elementary reaction step that determines the overall rate law
of the reaction

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The RDS is always the slowest step of the reaction that has the highest activation energy
    <ol type="i">
      <li>  
        If a molecule has enough kinetic energy to overcome the highest potential energy
        barrier, all other (smaller) barriers will be easy to overcome
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Side-stepping occurs when a different elementary step is preferred (that leads to the same
    product) as it is faster than the slow step
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** It is common to see consecutive reactions, where a reactant produces an intermediate, that
subsequently decays into the product

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Very common in nuclear decay and biochemical processes
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** Approximations are very useful for consecutive reactions

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Pre-equilibrium: The assumption that the intermediate is in rapid equilibrium with its reactants
    <ol type="i">
      <li>  
        Condition: the decay of the intermediate must be slow enough that the
        intermediate can be approximated to reach equilibrium with its reactants
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Steady-state approximation: The assumption that the concentrations of all intermediates
    remain constant and small throughout the reaction
    <ol type="i">
      <li>  
        As the concentrations remain constant, the net rate formation of intermediate = 0
      </li>
      <li>
        In some cases, it may be wise to also approximate that some rate laws are much
        more significant than others and negate those that aren't as significant
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** unimolecular reactions occur according to the Lindemann mechanism

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    According to collision theory, it seems unimolecular reactions are impossible as one
    molecule cannot collide by itself
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead, two molecules collide together to form an energetically excited reactant molecule
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This excited molecule can either go on to form products or to go back into its
        ground state
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
