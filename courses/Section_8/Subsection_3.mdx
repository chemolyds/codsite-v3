## 8.3.1 Temperature and Rate

**I** For a reaction to occur, the energy of reactants must be equal or higher than the activation energy

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    as temperature increases, the rates of all reactions increase.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>  
        Both wanted and unwanted reactions occur faster as $\textrm{T}$ increases.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Arrhenius equation: An equation that defines temperature dependence on rate constant
    $\textrm{ln} (\textrm{k}_{r}) = \textrm{ln} (\textrm{A}) - \frac{\textrm{E}_{a}}{\textrm{RT}}$ (Eq. 137)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>  
        $\textrm{A}$ and $\textrm{E}_{a}$ are known as the Arrhenius parameters; they are found experimentally
      </li>
      <li>
        $\textrm{A}$ is known as the frequency factor (rate at which collisions occur)
      </li>
      <li>
        $\textrm{E}_{a}$ is known as the activation energy
      </li>
      <li>
        there is another form of this equation, that is used more commonly:
        $\textrm{k}_{r} = \textrm{Ae}^{-\frac{\textrm{E}_{a}}{\textrm{RT}}}$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    From the Arrhenius equation, we can see that for the rate constant,
    <ol type="i">
      <li> 
        higher activation energy results in stronger dependence of temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        lower activation energy results in smaller dependence of temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the Arrhenius equation can be used when two temperature and two rate constants are
    given without the need of the Arrhenius parameters:
    $\textrm{ln}\frac{\textrm{k}_{r2}}{\textrm{k}_{r1}} = \frac{\textrm{E}_{A}}{\textrm{R}} (\frac{1}{\textrm{T}_{1}} - \frac{1}{\textrm{T}_{2}})$ (Eq. 139)
  </li>
  <li>
    The pre-exponential factor can be calculated by the following:
    $\textrm{A} = \sigma (\frac{8\textrm{kT}}{\pi \mu})^{\frac{1}{2}} \textrm{N}_{A}$ (Eq. 140)
    <ol type="i">
      <li> 
        $\mu$ is known as “reduced mass”, $\mu = \frac{\textrm{m}_{A}\textrm{m}_{B}}{\textrm{m}_{A}+\textrm{m}_{B}}$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 8.3.2 Collision Theory

**II** Collision theory: when gaseous reactants collide, the product is formed only if the reactants
collide with a certain minimum kinetic energy & correct orientation

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    reaction profile: illustrates the potential energy of reactants as they approach one another
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the potential energy of the molecules rises when they contact (repulsion); old
        bonds start to break and new bonds start to form.
      </li>
      <li>
        the potential energy reaches maximum (the activation energy) when the reactants
        are highly distorted (old bonds mostly broken, new bonds partly formed)
      </li>
      <li>
        The reactants must collide with enough kinetic energy to overcome the increase
        in potential energy
      </li>
      <li>
        as new bonds fully form and the product molecules separate, the potential energy
        decreases (Ref. Figure 88)
      </li>
      <li>
        The reaction coordinate indicates how far the reaction has progressed
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    The rate of collision (collision frequency) between two molecules (A and B) is
    proportional to both concentrations of A and B.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can be used to calculate the fraction of molecules
    that exceed a certain kinetic energy ($\nu_{min}$) at a certain temperature
    <ol type="i">
      <li> 
        The Boltzmann distribution states that $\textrm{N}_{i} \propto \textrm{e}^{-\frac{\textrm{E}_{a}}{\textrm{RT}}}$ (Ref. 5.2.2)
      </li>
      <li>
        Therefore, the collision frequency is $\nu \propto [\textrm{A}][\textrm{B}] \textrm{e}^{-\frac{\textrm{E}_{a}}{\textrm{RT}}}$
      </li>
      <li>
        This relationship implies that $\textrm{k}_{r} \propto \textrm{e}^{-\frac{\textrm{E}_{a}}{\textrm{RT}}}$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 8.3.3 Transition State Theory

**III** The transition-state theory is an extension of collision theory that can be applied in general

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    An activated complex is the physical state that corresponds to the peak
    potential energy
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if there is not enough kinetic energy, the activated complex collapses
        back into reactants
      </li>
      <li>
        if there is enough kinetic energy, the cluster of atoms becomes product
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
