# 8.5 Catalysis

---

**I** catalysts: substances that provide an alternative pathway for a chemical reaction

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    often the alternative pathway tends to lower the activation energy of the reaction
  </li>
  <li>
    this increases the overall rate of reaction, but does not change the equilibria
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        both the forward and reverse rate are increased
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    A mechanism may involve a catalyst but cannot be present in neither the reactant or
    product side of the final chemical equation
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the catalyst must remain unchanged in the process
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**II** homogeneous catalysts: catalysts in the same phase as the reaction mixture

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    enzymes, catalysts that regulate biological processes, are common homogeneous catalysts
  </li>
</ol>

**III** heterogeneous catalysts: catalysts that is in a different phase than to the reaction mixture

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    catalysts that utilize adsorption are very common
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        often involves gas molecules (adsorbate) adsorbing to the metal surface
        (adsorbent), forming either a chemical bond (chemisorption)
      </li>
      <li>
        adsorption may also occur through van der Waals interactions (physisorption)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    as the surface area of the adsorbent increases, so does the reaction rate
  </li>
</ol>
