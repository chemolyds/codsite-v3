## 4.4.1 Order

**I** Liquids are held together by intermolecular forces (like solids) but have enough energy to move
past one another (like gases).

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A liquid is short-range order; it arranges orderly over short distances
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules is short-range order
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    there is also long-range order; its orderly arranagement is repeated over
    long distances.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        crystalline ice (a solid) possess long-range order in a hexagonal
        lattice
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.4.2 Viscosity, Surface Tension, and Capillary Action

**II** viscosity: A liquid's resistance to flow

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the viscosity of a liquid is dependent on its intermolecular forces.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>high viscosity has sluggish flow and is hard to move</li>
      <li>low viscosity has natural flow and is easy to move</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    viscosity is hard to predict for a liquid as:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the ease of which positions the molecules can take as the liquid flows
        is significant
      </li>
      <li>entanglement (esp. for long chain molecules) affects viscosity</li>
      <li>
        viscosity decreases as temperature increases due to higher kinetic
        energy
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**III** surface tension: The net inward pull towards the center of the liquid

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    molecules with strong intermolecular forces will have high surface tension
  </li>
  <li>
    surface tension can be used to explain the everyday phenomena of liquids
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        water drops are spherical in a waxy surface due to surface tension
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    surface tension decreases as temperature increases
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        higher kinetic energy results in more motion to overcome intermolecular
        forces
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    when the liquid has strong interactions with the surface, it tends to
    maximize its contact by spreading
    <ol type="i">
      <li>water and paper interaction (known as “wetting”)</li>
      <li>chromatography</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**IV** capillary action: The rise of liquids in narrow tubes

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    occurs when there are favorable interactions between the tube and the liquid
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        adhesion is the forces that bind the molecules of a liquid to a surface
      </li>
      <li>
        cohesion is the forces that bind the molecules of a liquid together
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the shape of a liquid's meniscus is a relative indicator of cohesion vs.
    adhesion
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.4.3 Liquid Crystals

**V** Liquid crystals: substances that flow like viscous liquids but lie in a moderate orderly array

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    liquid crystals are an example of mesophase (intermediate of long-range &
    short-range)
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** liquids can be anisotropic or isotropic

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    anisotropic: materials with properties that depend on the direction of
    measurement
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        all liquid crystals are anisotropic; its viscosity is different with
        different direction
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    isotropic: materials with properties that do not depend on the direction of
    measurement
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        water is isotropic; their viscosity is the same with different direction
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    liquid crystals can be classified into three classes:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        nematic phase: molecules that lie in the same direction but staggered
      </li>
      <li>
        smectic phase: molecules that lie in the same direction but line up as
        well
      </li>
      <li>
        cholesteric phase: ordered layers but each layer is at a different angle
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** liquid crystals can also be classified by how it is prepared

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    thermotropic: liquid crystals that are prepared by melting the solid phase
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        these compounds act as liquid crystals at a certain range of temperature
      </li>
      <li>
        these compounds become isotropic liquids when heated above a certain
        temperature
      </li>
      <li>
        thermotropic liquid crystals are used in digital watches, computer
        screen, and thermometers
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    lyotropic: a material that forms liquid crystal phases upon the addition of
    a solvent
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.4.4 Ionic Liquids

**VIII** ionic liquids: liquids that are ionic compounds that have low vapor pressures and can dissolve
organic compounds

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    typically has a relatively small anion (like $\textrm{BF}_{4}^{2-}$) and a huge cation to prevent crystallization
  </li>
  <li>
    in general, cations should not be symmetrical and contain a large nonpolar region to prevent crystallization
  </li>
  <li>
    Ionic liquids are a big part of green chemistry, as normal liquid solvents tend to be harmful to the environment and have a health risk due to high toxic vapors
  </li>
</ol>
