# 4.2 Intermolecular Forces

---

## 4.2.1 Introduction

**I** Intermolecular forces (IMF): the attractions between molecules

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    all intermolecular forces are based on the Coulomb interaction between two charges:
    $E_{p}=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}$ (Eq.30)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        $E_{p}$ illustrates the potential energy of the ions, $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are the
        charges of two ions, r is the distance between the two ions.
      </li>
      <li>
        the stronger the charges of the ions, or the smaller the distance
        between the two ions, the stronger the attraction
      </li>
      <li>
        remember that attractions lower the potential energy
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    intermolecular forces tend to be much weaker than chemical bonds
  </li>
</ol>

**II** different types of intermolecular forces exist:

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      ion-dipole interaction: $E_{p} \propto \frac{-|z| \mu}{r^{2}}$
    </li>
    <li>
      dipole-dipole interaction: $E_{p} \propto \frac{\mu_{1} \mu_{2}}{r^{3}}$
    </li>
    <li>
      dipole-induced-dipole: $E_{p} \propto \frac{\mu_{1} \alpha_{2}}{r^{6}}$
    </li>
    <li>
      London dispersion forces: $E_{p} \propto \frac{\alpha_{1} \alpha_{2}}{r^{6}}$
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Although Eq.30 has an exponent of r of 1, the intermolecular forces seen here all
            have exponents of r greater than two. This is because Eq.30 illustrates ionic
            bonding, which is the interaction between two charged ions.
          </li>
          <li>
            as the intermolecular force gets weaker, its strength becomes much more
            dependent on the distance between the two molecules
          </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

## 4.2.2 Ion-Dipole forces

**III** Ion-dipole forces occur when an ion interacts with a polar molecule

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    a key factor of hydration (surrounding ions with water) are ion-dipole
    forces
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        hydration allows many ionic solids to dissolve, as ion-dipole forces
        stabilize the high-energy ions by lowering its energy
      </li>
      <li>
        small, high charged ions (strong polarizing power) are hydrated more
        extensively (higher charge allows stronger IMFs) than large, small
        charged ions (polarizable)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    although they have significant interactions, they are weaker than chemical
    bonds as:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the polar molecule charges are partial instead of a full charge like
        ions
      </li>
      <li>
        repulsive forces from the like-charged end of the molecule diminish the
        attractive forces of the opposite-charged end of the molecule.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
## 4.2.3 Dipole-Dipole forces

**IV** Dipole-dipole forces occur when polar molecules are arranged with opposite
charges together

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the strength of the dipole-dipole force depends on the polarity of the
    molecules
  </li>
  <li>
    the partial like-charges of each molecule tends to weaken the attractive
    force from partial opposite-charges and are even weaker than ion- dipole
    forces.
  </li>
</ol>

**V** The attractions between opposite charges and repulsions between like charges
cancel out for rotating polar molecules

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U8TMiOd.png" />

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    rotating polar molecules tend to linger in energetically favorable
    orientations and have a weak net attraction
  </li>
  <li>
    this attraction is $E_{p} \propto \frac{\mu_{1} \mu_{2}}{r^{6}}$
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        gas molecules tend to rotate (almost) freely and therefore have minimal
        intermolecular forces between them
      </li>
      <li>
        in liquids and solids, molecules do not rotate and therefore have stronger dipole-
        dipole forces than gases
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.2.4 London Forces

**VI** the existence of London forces is supported by the fact that monoatomic noble gases can exist in
the liquid state

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    in order for molecules to come together, there must be some kind of
    intermolecular force
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** these forces arise from heterogenous electron density for short periods of time

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    remember that electron clouds only represent the probability of a molecule;
    as electrons are particles, they can never be homogenous in at a given
    instant
  </li>
  <li>
    This forms a fleeting partial positive and negative charge and induces a
    neighboring molecule to be polarized as well (and so on)
  </li>
  <li>
    London forces depend on the polarizability ($\alpha$) of a molecule and its
    shape
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        highly polarizable molecules can have large instantaneous dipole moments
        and therefore strong London forces.
      </li>
      <li>
        molecules with a larger surface area allows for greater contact points
        between molecules and therefore stronger London forces.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII.** Dipole-induced-dipole interactions are similar to London forces:

<ol type="a">
  <li>the polar molecule induces a temporary dipole on a non-polar molecule</li>
</ol>

## 4.2.5 Hydrogen Bonding

**IX** Hydrogen bonds are a special case of dipole-dipole interaction

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A very electronegative atom pulls electron density away from the hydrogen,
    making the hydrogen atom unshielded, or very low in electron density
  </li>
  <li>
    this little electron density leads to a rather high degree of partial
    positive charge
  </li>
  <li>
    traditionally, it was thought that hydrogen bonding occurred when the
    hydrogen atom was connected to nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine atom with a
    lone pair
  </li>
  <li>
    the modern definition of hydrogen bonding simply requires the
    electronegativity difference between hydrogen and the fragment component to
    be high
  </li>
</ol>

**X** There are many types of hydrogen bonding:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    acetic acids often exist in the vapor phase as dimers due to H-bonding (Ref.
    Figure 44)
  </li>
  <li>
    hydrogen fluoride exists in long chains or $(HF)_6$ rings in the gas phase
    (Ref. Figure 43)
  </li>
  <li>intramolecular hydrogen bonding may occur as well (Ref. Figure 42)</li>
</ol>

## 4.2.6 Repulsions

**XI** Although the molecular orbital theory was mainly used to illustrate
bonding in prior sections, it can be used to illustrate repulsions as well:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    consider two helium molecules as they come closer together:
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0WNxLKc.png" />
  </li>
  <li>
    because an antibonding orbital increases the energy slightly more than a
    bonding orbital decreases the energy, there is a net increase in energy with
    smaller distance (Ref. 3.5.3)
  </li>
  <li>
    this increase in energy forces the molecules to repel each other to return
    to a lower energy state.
  </li>
</ol>

**XII** Repulsions drastically increase as distance decreases as increasing orbital overlap leads to
stronger repulsions

**XIII** Repulsions exponentially decrease as distance increases.
