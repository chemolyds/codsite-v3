# 4.3 Gas

---

## 4.3.1 Introduction

**I** There are three properties of the gaseous state that you should know:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the gaseous state much more compressible than solids or liquids
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        there is more space between gas particles than solid or liquid
        particles.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    gas molecules move very rapidly and therefore respond quickly to changes
  </li>
  <li>
    the motion of gas molecules is chaotic and random
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the pressure of gases is homogenous (the force exerted by the gas on the
        walls is almost always constant)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.3.2 Pressure

**II** pressure (P): defined as the force of the gas over the area the force is exerted on $P = \frac {F}{A}$ (Eq.31)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    force can be simply thought of the “push” that gas particles exert on the
    surroundings
  </li>
  <li>
    the atmospheric pressure (pressure exerted by air) was famously measured by
    Torricelli using a mercury barometer (Ref. Figure 46)
  </li>
  <li>
    the atmospheric pressure can be determined using Eq. 32 for any barometer (d
    = density): $P = d \, h \, g$ (Eq. 32)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        using water (that is less dense than mercury) would result in a higher
        height compared to a mercury barometer at the same atmospheric pressure
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**III** a manometer is used to compare the pressure of two different regions

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    An open manometer is used to compare the pressure of the sample with the atmosphere
  </li>
  <li>
    closed manometer is used to compare the pressure of the sample with a vacuum
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        think of a barometer that can measure pressures besides the atmospheric pressure

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kA4sx53.png" />
      </li>
    </ol>

  </li>
</ol>

**IV** There are many different units of pressure:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    pascal (Pa): The SI unit for pressure ($\textrm{kg} \, \textrm{m}^{-1} \,
    \textrm{s}^{-2}$)
  </li>
  <li>standard pressure ($P^\varnothing$): 1 bar (= 105 Pa = 100 kPa)</li>
  <li>atmosphere (atm): 1 atm = 1.013 25 $\times$ 105 Pa = 101.325 kPa</li>
  <li>millimeters of mercury (mmHg): 760 mmHg = 1 atm</li>
  <li>torr (torr): 760 torr = 760 mmHg = 1 atm</li>
</ol>

## 4.3.3 The Ideal Gas Law

**V** Boyle's Law: at constant temperature and amount of gas, $(\textrm{Volume}) \displaystyle \propto \frac{1}{(\textrm{Pressure})}$

$P \, V = k$ (Eq.33)

**VI** Charles' Law: at constant pressure and amount of gas, $(\textrm{Volume}) \displaystyle \propto (\textrm{Temperature})$

$\frac{V}{T} = b$ (Eq.34)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    extrapolation is essential for graphs related to Charles' law; all gases
    liquify before absolute zero (0 K), so it cannot be reached by practice
    (Ref. Figure 48)
  </li>
  <li>
    because volume cannot be negative, absolute zero is the lowest possible
    temperature
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** Gay-Lussac's Law: at constant volume and amount of gas, $(\textrm{Pressure}) \displaystyle \propto T$

$\frac{P}{T} = k$ (Eq.35)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dhk8Wcj.png" />

**VIII** Avogadro's principle: at constant pressure and temperature, a given number of gas molecules
will occupy the same volume regardless of its chemical properties

$V = n V_{m}$ (Eq.36)

<ol type="a">
  <li>the molar volume, or $V_{m}$, is the volume a mole of gas will occupy</li>
  <li>
    real gases will not have the same molar volume due to intermolecular
    interactions
  </li>
</ol>

**IX** ideal gas: a hypothetical gas that obeys the ideal gas law under all conditions

<ol type="a">
  <li>an ideal gas does not have any intermolecular interactions</li>
  <li>an ideal gas is moving point particles, and do not have any volume</li>
</ol>

**X** The combination of these empirical laws leads to the ideal gas law:

$P \, V \, = \, n \, R \, T$ (Eq.37)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the ideal gas law is a limiting law; the ideal gas law resembles a real gas as $P \rightarrow 0$.
  </li>
  <li>
    at high pressures and lower temperatures, the ideal gas model fails as molecular size and
    intermolecular forces become important
  </li>
  <li>
    for calculations, the gas law constant R is $\frac{0.08206 \, \textrm{L} \, \textrm{atm}}{\textrm{K} \, \textrm{mol}}$ (when pressure is in atm)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        do not use the 8.314 value! It is crucial that you always check your units.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.3.4 Applications of the Ideal Gas Law

**XI** Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP): 25 $^\circ C$ (298.15 K) and 1 bar pressure

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the molar volume ($V_{m}$) of an ideal gas at SATP is $24.79 \, \textrm{L}{' '}
    \, \textrm{mol}^{-1}$.
  </li>
</ol>

**XII** Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP): 0 $^\circ C$ (273.15 K) and 1 atm pressure

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the molar volume ($V_{m}$) of an ideal gas at STP is $22.41 \, \textrm{L} \,
    \textrm{mol}^{-1}$.
  </li>
</ol>

**XIII** The molar volume of an ideal gas can be calculated by:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $V_{m} = \frac{V}
    {n} = \frac{nRT / P}
    {n} = \frac{RT}
    {P}$ (Eq.38)
  </li>
</ol>

**XIV** The density of an ideal gas can be calculated by ($M_{r}$ is the molar mass of the gas)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $d = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{n M_{r}}{n V_{m}} = \frac{M_{r}}{V_{m}} = \frac{M_{r} P}{R T}$ (Eq.39)
  </li>
</ol>

**XV** The molar concentration of a gas can be calculated by:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $c = \frac{n}{V} = \frac{PV/RT}{V} = \frac{P}{RT} = \frac{1}{V_{m}}$ (Eq.40)
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.3.5 Mixture of Gases

**XVI** A mixture of gases that do not react with one another behaves like a single, pure gas

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Dalton's Law of Partial pressures: the total pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of
    the partial pressures of its components

    $P_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{P_i}$ (Eq.41)

  </li>
  <li>
    alternatively, this can be simplified by using this equation ($n_{tot}$ is the total moles of the
    mixture of the gas)

    $P_{tot} = \frac{n_{tot} RT}{V}$ (Eq.42)

  </li>
</ol>

**XVII** mole fraction (xi): the fraction a component contributes to the total amount of molecules in a
mixture

$x_{A} = \frac{n_{A}}{n_{tot}}$ (Eq.43)

<ol type="a">
  <li>the sum of all mole fractions in a mixture must equal 1.</li>
  <li>
    Dalton's law of partial pressures can be redefined using mole fractions; $P_
    {A} + P_{B} = x_{A} P + x_{B} P = (x_{A} + x_{B}) P = P$
  </li>
</ol>

4.3.6 Diffusion and Effusion

**XVIII** Two qualitative observations were made that illustrated the relationship between the average
speed of gas molecules, molar mass, and temperature

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    diffusion: the gradual dispersal of one substance through another substance
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        a bottle of vinegar gradually dispersing its pungent smell when it is
        opened
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    effusion: the escape of a gas through a small hole into a vacuum or region
    of lower pressure
    <ol type="i">
      <li>air escaping from a bicycle tire valve</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XIX** Graham's Law of Effusion: At constant temperature,

$(\textrm{Rate \, of \, effusion}) = \displaystyle \propto = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M_{r}}} \frac{\textrm{Rate \, of \, effusion \, of \, A \, molecules}}{\textrm{Rate \, of \, effusion \, of \, B \, molecules}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{B}}{M_{A}}} = \frac{t_B}{t_A}$ (Eq.44)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    effusions at different temperatures reveal that $(\textrm{rate \, of \, effusion}) = \displaystyle \propto \sqrt{T}$
  </li>
  <li>
    these two observations can be combined to reveal that $(\textrm{average \, speed}) = \displaystyle \propto \sqrt{\frac{T}{M_{r}}}$
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.3.7 The Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT)

**XX** Kinetic Molecular Theory: a model that predicts behavior of gas molecules with consideration
of the ideal gas model and effusion observations

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The model is based on five rules:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the volume of gas molecules are negligible
      </li>
      <li>
        A gas consists of a collection of molecules in ceaseless random motion
      </li>
      <li>
        Molecules move in straight lines (trajectories) until they collide
      </li>
      <li>
        the molecules do not influence one another except during collisions
      </li>
      <li>
        all collisions are elastic (momentum of gases is conserved)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the kinetic molecular theory can be used to derive the equation to calculate the root mean
    speed of gas molecules through temperature: $v-{rms} = \sqrt{v_{1}^{2} + v_{2}^{2} + v_{3}^{3} + ...}$

$PV = \frac{1}{3} n M v_{rms}^{2}$ (Eq.45)

  </li>
  <li>
    This equation can be rearranged in terms of temperature:

    $T= \frac{M_{r} v_{rms}^{2}}{3R}$ (Eq.46)

  </li>
  <li>
    the equation can be substituted with the ideal gas law:
  
  $v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_{r}}}$ (Eq.47)
  </li>
  <li>
    rearrangement of Eq. 17 gives:
  
  $E_{k_avg} = \frac{3}{2} RT$ (Eq.48)
  </li>
</ol>

**XXI** The empirical gas laws can be explained conceptually using the kinetic molecular theorem:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Boyle's law: as volume $\downarrow$, # of molecules in a given region
    $\uparrow$, # of collisions $\uparrow$, pressure $\uparrow$
  </li>
  <li>
    Charles' law: as temperature $\uparrow$, the average speed of a molecule
    $\uparrow$, pressure $\uparrow$, increase of pressure is counteracted by
    volume $\uparrow$
  </li>
  <li>
    Avogadro's Principle: as # of molecules $\uparrow$, the volume increases in
    order for the pressure of the gas to remain constant
  </li>
</ol>

**XXII** like all models, the kinetic model theorem has fundamental flaws:

<ol type="a">
  <li>it does not properly account for the volume of the molecules</li>
  <li>
    it does not account for the interaction between molecules (intermolecular
    forces)
  </li>
  <li>relativistic and quantum-mechanical effects are ignored.</li>
</ol>

**XXIII** Despite this, the kinetic molecular theory works fairly well even for polar gas molecules as they
rotate; their intermolecular forces are much weaker than solids or liquids (Ref. 4.2.3)

## 4.3.8 The Maxwell Distribution of Speeds

**XXIV** Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution: the distribution of the speeds of gas particles at a certain
temperature

$f(v) = 4 \pi (\frac{M_{r}}{2 \pi RT})^{\frac{3}{2}} v^{2} e^{-\frac{M v^{2}}{2RT}}$ (Eq. 49)

<ol type="a">
  <li>derived from the kinetic molecular theory</li>
  <li>lighter molecules have higher average speeds but also wider intervals</li>
  <li>
    as temperature increases, the average molecular speed increases, and the
    interval becomes wider
  </li>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ihxe0o.png" />
</ol>

## 4.3.9 Deviations from Ideality

**XXV** real gases: gases in the real world that deviate from the ideal gas model

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the ideal gas law is a limiting law; it is only valid as $P \rightarrow 0.$
  </li>
  <li>
    the effects of intermolecular forces on its deviations can be illustrated using the
    compression factor (z) where
    $z = \frac{V_{m}}{V_{m,ideal}}$ (Eq.50)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the compression factor of an ideal gas is 1 as it has no intermolecular forces
      </li>
      <li>
        if z > 1, repulsive forces dominate and it tends to drive the
        molecules apart; $V_{m}$ increases
      </li>
      <li>
        if z < 1, attractive forces dominate and it tends to draw the
        molecules together; $V_{m}$ decreases
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YKiVznQ.png" />
  </li>
  <li>
    At high pressures, the separation between molecules are smaller and
    therefore repulsive forces dominate, leading to a higher compression
    factor. (Ref. Figure 50)
  </li>
  <li>
    at low pressures, the separation between molecules are big and therefore attractive forces
    dominate. (Ref. Figure 50)
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.3.10 Real Gases and Liquefaction

**XXVI** virial equation:

$PV = nRT(1 + \frac{B}{V_{m}} + \frac{C}{V_{m}} + ...)$ (Eq.51)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the coefficients in the equation (B, C, ...) are known as virial
    coefficients
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        all of these coefficients are determined experimentally and dependent on
        temperature
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the virial equation predicts real gases very accurately, but it is extremely
    difficult to interpret the data without advanced analysis
  </li>
</ol>

**XXVII** van der Waals equation:

    $(P + \frac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}})(V - nb) = nRT$ (Eq.52)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    van der Waals parameters (a and b) are temperature independent and unique to
    each gas
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        a coefficient represents attractions (considers intermolecular forces)
      </li>
      <li>b coefficient represents repulsions (considers size of molecules)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XXVIII** molecules have low kinetic energy at low temperatures (Ref. Eq. 48); molecules stick together
when they do not have enough kinetic energy to overcome IMFs.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Joule-Thomson effect: provided that attractive forces are dominant, a real
    gas cools as it expands.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        expansion forces gas molecules to overcome attractive forces, lowering
        their kinetic energy (and therefore temperature) and increasing their
        potential energy (collapse of intermolecular forces)
      </li>
      <li>
        hydrogen and helium have weak attractive interactions and get warmer as
        they expand.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the lowering of the average speed of molecules is equivalent to lowering its
    temperature (Ref. Eq. 48)
  </li>
</ol>
