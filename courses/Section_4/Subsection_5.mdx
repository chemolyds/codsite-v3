# 4.5 Solids

---

## 4.5.1 Introduction

**I** The nature of the solid depends on the type of forces that hold its components together

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    amorphous solid: atoms, ions, or molecules that lie in a disorderly array
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        amorphous solids are short-range order like liquids; they are “frozen liquids”
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            butter, rubber, and glass are typical examples of amorphous solids
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    crystalline solid: atoms, ions, or molecules that lie in an orderly array
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        crystalline solids are long-range order
      </li>
      <li>
        they are typically flat and have well-defined planar surfaces known as crystal faces
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**II** crystalline solids can be further categorized by the types of bonds that hold them together:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    molecular solids: discrete molecules that are held together by intermolecular forces
  </li>
  <li>
    network solids: atoms extensively covalently bonded to their neighbors
  </li>
  <li>
    metallic solids: metal cations with a sea of electrons
  </li>
  <li>
    ionic solids: ions held together through mutual attraction
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.5.2 Molecular Solids

**III** physical properties of molecular solids are based on strength of their intermolecular forces

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    amorphous molecular solids are soft
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          its weak intermolecular forces and disorder makes it easy to push past one
          another (like wax, spreads easily)
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    crystalline molecular solids are hard and brittle
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        its strong intermolecular forces and order makes it very hard to push past one another (like sugar, doesn’t spread at all)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    molecular solids can also be tough
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        ultrahigh-density polyethylene used in bulletproof vests
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.5.3 Network Solids

**IV** network solids have atoms held together by strong covalent bonds throughout the solid, like a
network

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    network solids are often very hard, rigid materials with high melting and boiling points
  </li>
</ol>

**V** the two allotropes of carbon, graphite and diamond, are both network solids. The two allotropes
have strikingly different properties:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    diamond has each carbon atom in a tetrahedral arrangement with sp3 hybridization
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the strong $\sigma$ bonds of carbon atoms explain its hardness
      </li>
      <li>
        diamonds are formed under extreme pressures
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    graphite consists of flat sheets of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in a hexagonal arrangement
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        it possesses a delocalized π network; its π electrons are delocalized throughout
        the entire molecule
      </li>
      <li>
        graphite is anisotropic; its electrical conductivity is much better in the parallel
        direction than perpendicular
      </li>
      <li>
        if impurities exist within the graphite layers, they can be used as a lubricant as
        the layers slide very easily
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** ceramic materials are non-crystalline inorganic oxides with a network structure

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    its bonds have strikingly significant covalent character
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.5.4 Metallic Solids

**VII** an array of metal cations that are bounded together by a sea of electrons

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    metallic solids are lustrous, malleable, and ductile
  </li>
  <li>
    its luster occurs due to mobilized electrons
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        an incident light strikes the surface of the metal
      </li>
      <li>
        an electron absorbs this and oscillates in step with the incident light
      </li>
      <li>
        the electron then emits light in the same frequency
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    its malleability and ductility can also be explained by mobilized electrons
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        even if its cations move drastically, the sea of electrons can
        adjust easily
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** many metallic solids have different types of structures; in these structures, atoms are illustrated as
hard spheres for convenience.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    close-packed structure: atoms stacked together with maximum efficiency
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        close-packed structures have the least amount of empty
        space; the atoms occupy 74% of space
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    there are two close-packed structures you need to know:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        hexagonal close-packed structure (hcp): ABAB configuration
      </li>
      <li>
        cubic close-packed structure (ccp): ABC configuration
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    coordination number (CN): the number of nearest neighboring
    atoms of each atom
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        all close-packed structures have a coordination number of 12
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**IX** tetrahedral holes: a dip between three atoms

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the size of tetrahedral holes allows atoms with 0.225 times the radius
    of the atoms that form the hole to fit it.
  </li>
</ol>

**X** octahedral holes: a hole which a dip in one layer coincides with a dip in
another layer

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the size of octahedral holes are around double the size of tetrahedral holes.
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.5.5 Unit Cells

**XI** unit cell: the smallest unit that can reproduce the entire crystal

**XII** some common unit cells are:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    face-centered cubic (fcc) structure: one atom at each corner, one atom at the center of
    each face
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        this is equivalent to the cubic close-packed structure, has coordination number of
        12 and occupies 74% of the space
      </li>
      <li>
        there are four atoms in total that contribute to one fcc unit cell.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZFXkPx2.png" />

  <li>
    body-centered cubic (bcc) structure: one atom at each corner, and a single atom at the center
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        has a coordination number of 8 (not a close-packed structure) and occupies 68%
        of the space
      </li>
      <li>
        there are two atoms that contribute to one bcc unit cell.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z2R6Riu.png" />

  <li>
    primitive cubic structure: one atom at each corner
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        has a coordination number of 6, and occupies 52.3% of the space
      </li>
      <li>
        there is only one atom in total that contributes to this unit cell.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XIII** Bravais lattices: 14 basic patterns of unit cells that can express any crystal structure

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cG7iZRl.png" />

**XIV** the density of these solids (through the unit cell) can be calculated by the equation below:

$d = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{n \times m_{atom}}{V} = \frac{n \times m_{r}}{N_{atom} \times a^{3}}$ (Eq.53)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $a$ is the side length of a unit cell.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        for FCC structures, $a = 2 \sqrt{2r}$
      </li>
      <li>
        for BCC structures, $a = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} r$
      </li>
      <li>
        for primitive cubic structures, a = 2r
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 4.5.6 Ionic Solids

**XV** ionic solids have structures that are similar to metallic solids, but have much more variables

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    some of these variables are that ion sizes are different, and charges of ions are opposite
  </li>
  <li>
    ionic solids are not an electron sea model; in fact, it is the exact opposite
  </li>
  <li>
    the ions (represented as hard spheres) stack together in the arrangement that has the
    lowest total energy
  </li>
</ol>

**XVI** radius ratio (ρ): the ratio between the cation radii and the anion radii

$\rho = \frac{r_{smaller}}{r_{larger}}$ (Eq.54)

**XVII** some of the ionic solid structures are (when anions are larger than cations):

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    rock-salt structure (0.4 < $\rho$ < 0.7): anions in fcc configuration, cations in octahedral holes
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium oxide (MgO)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    cesium-chloride structure ($\rho$ > 0.7): anions in expanded cubic array, cations in cubic holes
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        cesium chloride (CsCl), thallium chloride (TlCl)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    zinc-blende structure ($\rho$ < 0.4): anions in expanded ccp, cations occupying half the
    tetrahedral holes
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        one type of zinc sulfide (ZnS)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVIII** The sphere packing model may break down if the bonds are not entirely ionic.
