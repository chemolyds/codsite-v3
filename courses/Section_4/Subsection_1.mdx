# 4.1 Introduction

---

**I** bulk matter: forms of matter that consist of large numbers of molecules

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    macroscopic observation results from the behavior of many individual
    molecules together (bulk matter)
  </li>
  <li>
    microscopic observation results from the behavior of individual molecules
  </li>
</ol>

**II** States of matter are examples of bulk matter. The three commonly used in chemistry are:

<ol type="a">
  <li>solid state is when bulk matter maintains a fixed volume and shape.</li>
  <li>
    liquid state is when bulk matter maintains a fixed volume, but not shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    gaseous state is when bulk matter does not maintain a fixed volume or shape.
  </li>
</ol>
