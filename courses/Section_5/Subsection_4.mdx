# 5.4 Gibbs Free Energy

---

## 5.4.1 Definition

**I** In order to avoid determining spontaneity by calculating both the change in entropy of the
surroundings and the system, the state function Gibbs energy (G) was introduced

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The Gibbs Free Energy is defined as G = H âˆ’ TS, but the change in free energy is more
    commonly used:
    $\Delta \textrm{G} = \Delta \textrm{H} - \textrm{T} \Delta \textrm{S}$ (Eq. 98)
  </li>
  <li>
    provided that the temperature and pressure of the system is constant,
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}$ is greater than zero, the reverse process is spontaneous
      </li>
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}$ is equal to zero, the process is at equilibrium
      </li>
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}$ is less than zero, the forward process is spontaneous
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the direction of spontaneous change is always in the direction of decreasing free energy.
  </li>
</ol>

## 5.4.2 Usage of Free Energy

**II** Gibbs free energy of reaction ($\Delta \textrm{G}$): the difference in molar Gibbs free energies of the products
and reactants

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    like the change in enthalpy and entropy for a reaction, it can be calculated by:
    $\Delta \textrm{G} = \sum_{\textrm{products}} \textrm{n} \textrm{G}_{m} - \sum_{\textrm{reactants}} \textrm{n} \textrm{G}_{m}$ (Eq. 99)
  </li>
  <li>
    there is a crucial difference between this and the standard Gibbs free energy of
    reaction; the Gibbs free energy of reaction in terms of the standard molar Gibbs energies
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        there is only one possible value for $\Delta \textrm{G}^{\Theta}$ in a particular reaction and temperature
      </li>
      <li>
        the value of $\Delta \textrm{G}$ changes as the composition of the reaction mixture changes,
        and therefore its value and sign may change as the reaction proceeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**III** Eq. 99 is rarely used as their absolute values are rarely known; the changes of Gibbs free energy
is what is extremely useful.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    standard Gibbs free energy of formation ($\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$): the change in standard free energy
    (per mole) from its elements in their most stable form (known as reference state) to its
    final product
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the values of $\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$ can be calculated through the definition of free energy.
      </li>
      <li>
        $\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta} = 0$ for elements in their most stable form.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    this value also is an indication of stability of a certain molecule:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$ is positive, the molecule is a thermodynamically unstable compound
        that is less stable than its elements in their most stable form (reference states)
      </li>
      <li>
        if $\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$ is negative, the molecule is a thermodynamically stable compound
        that is more stable than its elements in their most stable form (reference states)
      </li>
      <li>
        although molecules with positive $\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$ maybe thermodynamically unstable, they
        can last forever if its decomposition is very slow (remember, thermodynamics is
        independent of kinetics!)
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            benzene is thermodynamically unstable, but can last a lifetime.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Like Eq. 82, the Gibbs free energies of reaction can be calculated by $\Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$ of its
    reactants and products:
    $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}^{\Theta} = \sum_{\textrm{products}} \textrm{n} \Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta} - \sum_{\textrm{reactants}} \textrm{n} \Delta \textrm{G}_{f}^{\Theta}$ (Eq. 100)
  </li>
</ol>
