## 5.1.1 Introduction

**I** Thermodynamics: the study of transformations of energy between work and heat

<ol type="a">
  <li>heat and work are two different ways energy can be transferred</li>
</ol>

**II** The study of thermodynamics can be divided into two regions of interest:

<ol type="a">
  <li>system: the region of interest</li>
  <li>surroundings: everything else</li>
  <li>universe: the system and the surroundings</li>
</ol>

**III** The system and the surroundings can also be classified by what can be transferred:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    open system: matter and energy are exchangeable between the system and
    surroundings
  </li>
  <li>closed system: matter is not exchangeable, but energy is exchangeable</li>
  <li>
    isolated system: both matter and energy are nonexchangeable with the
    surroundings
  </li>
</ol>

**IV** there are terms that indicate specific conditions of a system:

<ol type="a">
  <li>isothermal: the temperature of the system stays constant</li>
  <li>isobaric: the pressure of the system stays constant</li>
  <li>isochoric: the volume of the system stays constant</li>
</ol>

**V** Energy: the capacity to do work or to heat an object

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A body may have energy by virtue of either its motion or its position
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        kinetic energy ($\textrm{E}_{k}$) is the energy of a body due to its
        motion
      </li>
      <li>
        potential energy ($\textrm{E}_{p}$) is the energy of a body due to its
        position
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the total store of energy in a system is called its internal energy
    ($\textrm{U}$)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>the internal energy cannot be measured or calculated.</li>
      <li>
        instead, the changes of internal energy ($\Delta \textrm{U}$) is
        measured.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** Thermodynamics in chemistry is often focused on the system; if not explicitly stated, assume
everything is referring to the system. (e.g. $\textrm{q}$ is equivalent to $\textrm{q}_{\textrm{sys}}$)

## 5.1.2 Work

**VII** work ($\textrm{w}$) is the process of achieving motion against an opposing force

$\textrm{w} = \textrm{F} \textrm {d}$ (Eq. 55)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $\textrm{F}$ is the opposing force against the system, and $\textrm{d}$ is
    the distance travelled.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the units for work are reported in Joules ($\textrm{J}, 1 \textrm{J} = 1
        \textrm{kg} \textrm{m}^{2} \textrm{s}^{-2}$)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>work simulates orderly motion of atoms in the surroundings.</li>
  <li>
    there are two important things about work:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if a force is being applied but no displacement results, no work is
        being done.
      </li>
      <li>
        if the force is perpendicular to the motion, no work is being done.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    when work is...
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        done on the surroundings: the capacity to do work decreases, and the
        internal energy of the system decreases. ($\textrm{w} \lt 0, \Delta
        \textrm{U} \lt 0$)
      </li>
      <li>
        done on the system: the capacity to do work increases, and the internal
        energy of the system increases. $\textrm{w} \gt 0, \Delta \textrm{U} \gt
        0$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    when a system only transfers energy as work, $\Delta \textrm{U} = \textrm{w}
    $.
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** work can be classified into two types of processes:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    expansion work: work that leads to a change in volume of the system
    <ol type="i">
      <li>gas expansion in a piston is a prime example of expansion work</li>
      <li>
        this section will mainly focus on the expansion work done by a gas in a
        cylinder against a piston (the opposing force)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    nonexpansion work: work that does not involve a change in volume of the
    system
    <ol type="i">
      <li>extension of a spring, raising a weight, electrical work, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** the work done by the gas when it expands by $\Delta \textrm{V}$ against a constant external pressure $\textrm{P}_{ex}$ is:

$\textrm{w} = -\textrm{P}_{ex} \Delta \textrm{V}$ (Eq. 56)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    when there is no external pressure on the system ($\textrm{P}_{ex} = 0$), no
    work is being done. This is known as free expansion.
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** mechanical equilibrium: when the force exerted by the system
is equal to the force exerted by the external pressure

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Eq. 56 requires the external pressure to be constant throughout the
    expansion process
  </li>
  <li>
    A system that remains in mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings at all
    stages of the expansion does maximum expansion work.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>this is also known as a reversible expansion.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
**IX** There are two types of processes in thermodynamics:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    reversible process: A process which can be reversed by an infinitesimal
    change (an extremely tiny change) in a variable
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        when a reversible process is undone, both the system and surroundings
        must remain unchanged to its original state.
      </li>
      <li>
        the reversible process is an idealization and cannot happen in a real
        system.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    irreversible process: A process which cannot be reversed by an infinitesimal
    change in a variable
  </li>
</ol>

**X** A reversible expansion is when the external pressure is continuously adjusted to match the
internal pressure of the system for every stage of the expansion.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    In other words, a system does maximum expansion work when it is in
    mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings at every stage of the
    expansion.
  </li>
  <li>
    In other words, maximum expansion work is achieved in a reversible change.
  </li>
</ol>

**XI** The work done by the reversible expansion of the gas is:

$\textrm{w} = - \textrm{n}\textrm{R}\textrm{T} \textrm{ln}\frac{\textrm{V}_{f}}{\textrm{V}_{i}}$ (Eq. 57)

## 5.1.3 Heat

**XII** heat ($\textrm{q}$): energy transferred as a result of temperature difference between the system and its surroundings

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    thermal energy is the sum of kinetic energies of each individual molecule
  </li>
  <li>temperature is the average of kinetic energy of molecules</li>
  <li>
    the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies is heat.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the body with higher thermal energy (which also has the higher
        temperature) will always transfer energy as heat to the body with lower
        thermal energy
      </li>
      <li>
        when two bodies possess the same thermal energy (and therefore the same
        temperature), the two bodies are in thermal equilibrium
      </li>
      <li>heat is just another way of transferring energy like work</li>
      <li>
        to put emphasis, heat is not a form of energy; it is a method of
        transfer
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    similar to work, if energy is solely transferred as heat, $\Delta \textrm{U}
    = \textrm{q}$
  </li>
  <li>
    when energy is transferred as heat...
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        to the surroundings: the thermal energy of the system decreases. This is
        known as an exothermic process. $\textrm{q} \lt 0, \Delta \textrm{U} \lt
        0$
      </li>
      <li>
        to the system: the thermal energy of the system increases. This is known
        as an endothermic process. ($\textrm{q} \gt 0, \Delta \textrm{U} \gt 0$)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    heat transfer stimulates random, disorderly motion of molecules in the
    surroundings
  </li>
</ol>

**XIII** the properties of the separation between the system and surroundings can be classified as well:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    diathermic: walls that permits heat transfer between the system and its
    surroundings
  </li>
  <li>
    adiabatic: walls that do not permit heat transfer between the system and its
    surroundings
  </li>
</ol>

**XIV** There are different types of units used for heat, other than Joules ($\textrm{J}, 1 \textrm{J} = 1 \textrm{kg} \textrm{m}^{2} \textrm{s}^{-2}$)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    calorie (cal): the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by
    1 $\degree \textrm{C}$.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>the modern definition is that 1 cal = 4.184 J</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    nutritional calorie (Cal): the heat requ5ired to raise the temperature of 1
    kg of water by $\degree \textrm{C}$.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>this is equivalent to 1 kcal and is what is used for most foods.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XV** heat capacity (C): the ratio of heat supplied to the change in temperature produced

$\textrm{C} = \frac{\textrm{q}}{\Delta \textrm{T}}$ (Eq. 58)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    heat capacity is an extensive property, it is better reported as an intensive property
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        specific heat capacity ($\textrm{C}_{s}$): the heat capacity divided by mass of body ($\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{m}}$)
      </li>
      <li>
        molar heat capacity ($\textrm{C}_{m}$): the heat capacity divided by moles of body ($\frac{\textrm{C}}{\textrm{n}}$)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    heat capacity can also differ depending on certain conditions:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        heat capacity at constant pressure ($\textrm{C}_{p}$)
      </li>
      <li>
        heat capacity at constant volume ($\textrm{C}_{v}$)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVI** calorimetry can be used to determine the energy transferred as heat

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the calorimeter is commonly calibrated with a known amount of energy transferred as
    heat to properly interpret the change in temperature
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        electrical heating through a known current and time allows precise calibration
      </li>
      <li>
        the amount of energy transferred as heat can be calculated by
        $\textrm{q}_{\textrm{cal}} = \textrm{l} \textrm{v} \Delta \textrm{t}$ (Eq.59)
      </li>
      <li>
        where I is the current, ν is the potential difference of the supply, and t is time.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the temperature change resulting from the calorimetry reaction can be calculated:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        $\textrm{q}_{\textrm{cal}} = −\textrm{q} = −\textrm{m} \textrm{C}_{s} \Delta \textrm{T} = −\textrm{n} \textrm{C}_{m} \Delta \textrm{T}$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVII** when an ideal gas goes through reversible isothermal expansion,

$\textrm{q} =\textrm{n} \textrm{R} \textrm{T} \textrm{ln}\frac{\textrm{V}_{f}}{\textrm{V}_{i}}$ (Eq. 61)
