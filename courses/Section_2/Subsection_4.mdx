## 2.4.1 Energy Levels

**I.** The hydrogen atom is similar to a particle-in-a-box with boundary conditions, except for the fact that the attraction of the nucleus confines
the electron, not a wall with infinite potential energy.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Similar to a particle-in-a-box, the energies are quantized and have discrete
    energy levels.
  </li>
</ol>

**II.** The energy levels in one-electron species are:

$\textrm{E}_{n} = - \frac{\textrm{Z}^{2}\textrm{hR}}{\textrm{n}^{2}} \left(\textrm{R} = \frac{\textrm{m}_{e}\textrm{e}^{4}}{8\textrm{h}^{3}\epsilon_{0}^{2}}\right)$

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the Rydberg constant (R) measured spectroscopically from the hydrogen emission
    spectrum is identical to the Rydberg's constant derived from fundamental constants
  </li>
  <li>
    the energy levels are negative as they are measured relative to a free electron
  </li>
  <li>
    In a single-electron atom, as nuclear charge (Z) increases, the electron is more tightly
    bound to the nucleus due to Coulomb's law. ($\textrm{F}_{e} = \textrm{k}_{e}\frac{\left|\textrm{q}_{1}\textrm{q}_{2}\right|}{\textrm{r}^{2}}$)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Nuclear charge is equivalent to the number of protons in an atom.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    As n approaches infinity, $\textrm{E}_{n}= 0$. The energy required for an electron to completely
    escape the attractive force of the atom is known as ionization energy (Ref. 2.6).
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.4.2 Atomic Orbitals

**III.** Atomic Orbitals: wavefunction of electrons in atoms

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Atomic orbitals are electron "clouds" centered around the nucleus. The
    density of the cloud at each point is represented by $\psi^{2}$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spherical polar coordinates are used to specify the exact location of each
    point around a nucleus using three parameters exist: $\textrm{r}, \theta,
    \phi$ (Ref. Figure 8)
    <ol type="a">
      <li>r - distance from the nucleus</li>
      <li>$\theta$ - angle from the positive z-axis (latitude)</li>
      <li>$\phi$ - angle about the z-axis (longitude)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**IV.** All wavefunctions can be represented as the product of these two wavefunctions:

$\psi \left( (\textrm{r},\theta,\phi) = \textrm{R}(\textrm{r})\times \textrm{Y}(\theta,\phi) \right) $ (Eq. 13)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Radial wavefunction: expresses how wavefunction varies on distance from the nucleus
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        describes the size of an orbital.
      </li>
      <li>
        the function purely depends on the r parameter.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Angular wavefunction: expresses how the wavefunction changes as angles change.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        In terms of probability, the angular wavefunction describes how the probability
        of an electron at a specific point changes from point to point at a given distance
      </li>
      <li>
        describes the shape and orientation of an orbital
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    the 1s atomic orbital of hydrogen is shown as an example:
    $\phi(\textrm{r},\theta,\phi) = \left(\frac{1}{\pi \textrm{a}_{0}^{3}}^{\frac{1}{2}} \textrm{e}^{\frac{-\textrm{r}}{\textrm{a}_{0}}} \right)$ (Eq. 14)
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          only the r parameter is included in this equation; therefore, the wavefunction is
          spherically symmetric, and independent of the angles $\theta,\phi$.
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Nodal surface: a surface with zero electron density, where $\psi = 0$.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          A nodal surface occurs when either $\textrm{R}(\textrm{r}) = 0$ or $\textrm{Y}(\theta,\phi) = 0$.
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.4.3 Quantum Numbers, Shells, and Subshells

**V.** When solving for a one-dimensional particle-in-a-box, only one quantum number (n, principal quantum number) is utilized.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    For a three-dimensional atom, three quantum numbers ($\textrm{n}, l, \textrm
    {m}_{l}$) are utilized.
  </li>
</ol>

**VI.** Principal quantum number (n): roughly determines the size of orbital and its energy

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    in a one-electron atom, all atomic orbitals with the same principal quantum
    number is degenerate (due to there being no repulsion between electrons)
  </li>
  <li>
    All of the orbitals with the same n belong to the same shell of an atom
  </li>
  <li>
    mean distance of an electron from the nucleus increases with the value of n
  </li>
</ol>

**VII.** Orbital angular momentum quantum number (l): determines the shape of the orbital

<ol type="a">
  <li>
  contributes to the energy of the orbital like principal quantum number, but not as much
  </li>
  <li>
    this quantum number can take the values of 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          there are n subshells (groups of orbitals with identical l) for a given orbital shell
          with principal quantum number n
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    As implied by the name, l can be used to calculate the orbital angular momentum of an
    electron, using the equation:
    (orbital angular momentum) = ${l(l + 1)^{\frac{1}{2}}\textrm{h}}$ (Eq. 15)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        In physics, angular momentum the quantity of rotation of a body.
      </li>
      <li>
        when l = 0, its angular momentum is also zero. Therefore, s-electrons do not
        circulate around the nucleus, but instead the electron cloud is "spherically
        distributed"
      </li>
      <li>
        angular momentum becomes important as electrons with low angular momentum
        (like ns electrons) spend more time closer to the nucleus compared to higher
        values of l.
      </li>
      <li>
        In chemistry, we say that the ns electron has greater penetration and shielding
        than orbitals with higher values of l. (Ref. 2.5.1)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII.** Magnetic quantum number ($\textrm{m}_{l}$): determines orientation of motion of the electron

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    this quantum number can take the values from $l$ to $-l$ (including zero)
  </li>
  <li>there are $2l + 1$ orbitals in a subshell of quantum number $l$.</li>
  <li>
    theses orbitals are degenerate in energy (even in many-electron species)
  </li>
  <li>
    the direction of the orbital magnetic angular momentum is dependent on the
    magnetic quantum number.
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.4.4 The Shape of Orbitals

**IX.** ns-orbital: The s-orbital ($l$ = 0) in a shell with the principal quantum number n

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Independent of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          All s-orbitals are spherically symmetrical
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The probability density of an electron at the point ($\textrm{r}, \theta, \phi$) is:
    $\psi^{2}(\textrm{r}, \theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{\pi \textrm{a}_{0}^{3}}\textrm{e}^{\frac{-2\textrm{r}}{\textrm{a}_{0}}}$
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          The probability approaches zero with increasing distance from the nucleus
        </li>
        <li>
          Practically, the electron is almost always found in < 250 pm distance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of drawing an orbital as an electron cloud, a boundary surface that
          encloses most of the electron cloud (with 90% probability that the electron will
          be found inside the surface) is drawn.
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Because an ns-orbital has no angular momentum, it does not fling away from the
    nucleus and has a nonzero probability of being found right at the nucleus
  </li>
</ol>

**X.** radial distribution function (P): total probability of finding an electron at a distance r at all
possible orientations (meaning, at all values of Î¸, $\phi$)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    For all orbitals, $\textrm{P}(\textrm{r}) = \textrm{r}^{2}\textrm{R}^{2}
    (\textrm{r}).$
  </li>
  <li>
    For ns-orbitals: $\textrm{P}(\textrm{r}) = 4\pi \textrm{r}^{2}\psi^{2} $(Eq.
    16)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>An s orbital is spherically symmetrical.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The probability of an electron found anywhere in a thin shell around the
    nucleus with radius r and thickness $\sigma \textrm{r}$ is given by $\textrm
    {P}(\textrm{r})\sigma \textrm{r}$
  </li>
  <li>
    Although for a 1s orbital $\psi^{2}$ reaches maximum as $\textrm{r}
    \rightarrow 0$, $\textrm{P}(\textrm{r}) = 0$ when r = 0.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This is because for a 1s orbital, the probability density determines one
        specific point of infinitesimal volume (where r = 0) meanwhile the
        region in which the electron is being sought is zero volume (and size)
        because the "radius" of the shell is zero, so $\textrm{P}(\textrm{r}) =
        0$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    As r increases, the shell gets bigger but $\psi^{2}$ decreases (for an
    1s-orbital)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bohr radius ($\textrm{a}_{0}$): the radius at which an 1s electron in a
    hydrogen atom is most likely to be found
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        The bohr radius is the distance where P is maximum for a 1s electron
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XI.** Radial nodes: nodes that occur when the radial function changes signs; P(r) = 0

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    there are n - l - 1 number of radial nodes.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>1s, 2p, 3d, and 4f orbitals do not have radial nodes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    gives the atomic orbitals a "layered" appearance
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JcYhd0I.png" />
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        A node is when a wavefunction (or in this case, the radial function
        '$\textrm{R}(\textrm{r})$') passes through zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 2p and 3d orbitals have zero radial nodes, while the 3p orbital has
        one radial node and the 4p orbital has two radial nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Although radial functions, and other wavefunctions, can be negative,
        radial distribution functions or anything else that indicates
        probability cannot be negative.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XII.** angular nodes: planar or conical nodes when the angular function changes signs; Y = 0

<ol type="a">
  <li>also known as nodal surfaces, there are l number of angular nodes</li>
  <li>
    An electron in a p-orbital has nonzero orbital angular momentum that allows
    it to "fling" away from the nucleus unlike an electron in a s-orbital.
  </li>
</ol>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ASJbsJb.png" />

XIII. the total number of orbitals in a shell with principal quantum number n is $\textrm{n}^{2}$

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Therefore, the total number of electrons that can fit in a shell is
    $2\textrm{n}^{2}$
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zig9VuF.png" />
    <ol type="i">
      <li>All of the radial distribution functions are zero when r = 0.</li>
      <li>
        As expected, there is one radial node for 2s, and two radial nodes for
        3s orbitals.
      </li>
      <li>
        The radius where an electron is most likely to be found increases as n
        increases; the graph is plotted using Bohr radius to avoid using small
        numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conveniently, the 1s electron has its highest probability when radius is
        equal to 1 with these units, as expected
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.4.5 Electron Spin

**XIV.** Spin: the property of an electron behaving somewhat like a spinning sphere

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    spin is a concept that was proposed to account for the slight deviations
    from SchrÃ¶dinger's predicted frequencies and observed spectral lines
  </li>
  <li>
    An electron can have two spin states; $\alpha (\uparrow)$ and
    $\beta(\downarrow)$
  </li>
  <li>
    represented by the spin magnetic quantum number (ms); can take values of
    ($\pm \frac{1}
    {2}$)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        $+\frac{1}
        {2}$ represents up spin ($\uparrow$), $-\frac{1}
        {2}$ represents up spin ($\downarrow$)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
