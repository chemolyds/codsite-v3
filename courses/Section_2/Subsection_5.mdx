# 2.5 Many-Electron Atoms

## 2.5.1 Orbital energies

**I** Many-electron species have more conditions to consider than a one-electron species as...

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    there are more protons, the greater nuclear charge means greater attraction.
  </li>
  <li>there is more than one electron, repulsions between electrons occur.</li>
  <li>
    there are repulsions between electrons, orbitals in the same shell are no
    longer degenerate as each orbital experience different levels of shielding
    and penetration
  </li>
</ol>

**II.** As a result of repulsive effects between electrons, the electron experiences less attraction than the
full attraction of the nucleus that an electron would experience if it was alone

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    think of these electrons experiencing a "watered-down version" of the full
    nuclear charge
  </li>
  <li>
    Shielding: an effect where each electron acts as a "shield" for other
    electrons further away from the nucleus, reducing electrostatic attraction
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        As atomic number increases, electrons are further drawn towards the
        nucleus and therefore, energy levels are lowered.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    opposite charges attract (green) and like charges repel (red). The electron
    on the left has both an interaction between the middle electron and the
    right nucleus, one repulsion and one attraction. These cancel out and the
    overall attraction the left electron experiences is much less than without
    the middle electron.
  </li>
</ol>

**III.** Effective nuclear charge ($\textrm{Z}_{eff}$): the actual experienced attraction by an electron with
consideration of electron - electron repulsions

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$ is always less than the actual nuclear attraction from the nucleus ($\textrm{Z}_{e}$) due to shielding
  </li>
  <li>
    Eq.12 can be modified for multi-electron species as shown below:
    $\textrm{E}_{n} = -\frac{\textrm{Z}_{eff}^{2} \textrm{h} \textrm{R}}{\textrm{n}^{2}}$ (Eq. 17)
  </li>
</ol>

**IV.** Penetration: An orbital with an electron that is found very close to the
nucleus is said to penetrate through the inner shells

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    s-orbitals have the greatest penetration because it has zero orbital angular
    momentum
  </li>
  <li>
    p-orbitals have much less penetration as it has orbital angular momentum
    that prevents it from approaching close to the nucleus
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        A p-orbital therefore is more effectively shielded and bounded less
        tightly because it is often further away from the nucleus
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.5.2 The Building-Up Principle

**V.** Aufbau Principle: A buildup of electrons in atoms as quantum
numbers get bigger and bigger.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    electrons are placed in orbitals to give the lowest total energy overall; me
    is insignificant
  </li>
  <li>
    Pauli Exclusion principle: every electron has a unique set of quantum
    numbers
  </li>
  <li>
    Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity: electrons are to be placed to give
    maximum total spin (maximum exchange energy, Ref. 2.5.3)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        two electrons in the same orbital have higher energy than if they were
        in different orbitals
      </li>
      <li>multiplicity: number of unpaired electrons + 1</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VI.** The exchange energy and Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity explains why the electron
configurations of chromium and copper have 4s1 unlike others; this configuration maximizes
exchange energy (lowest energy configuration)

## 2.5.3 Slater's Rules and Pairing Energy

**VII.** Slater's Rules: a set of rules that approximates effective nuclear charge.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Orbitals s and p are grouped with the same principal quantum number and d
    and f are grouped separately.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>(1s)(2s, 2p)(3s, 3p)(3d)(4s, 4p)(4d)(5s, 5p)(5d)(5f) â‹¯</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    electrons in groups to the right do not shield left electrons (Ref. Figure
    12)
  </li>
  <li>
    For ns and np valence electrons
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Each electron in the same group contributes 0.35 to S for each electron
        in the group. An 1s electron contributes 0.30 as an exception.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each electron in n - 1 group contributes 0.85 to S. (S stands for
        shielding)
      </li>
      <li>Each electron in n - 2 or lower groups contributes 1.00 to S.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    For nd and nf valence electrons:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Each electron in the same group contributes 0.35 to S for each other
        electron in the group.
      </li>
      <li>Each electron in n - 1 or lower groups contributes 1.00 to S.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The effective nuclear charge can then be approximated using the following
    equation: Z* = Z - S (Eq. 18)
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII.** Slater's rules and effective nuclear charge can be used to predict atomic
radii and ionic radii within the same period.

**IX.** Coulombic energy (of repulsion) ($\Pi_{c}$): the repulsion energy from two
electrons in the same orbital

<ol type="a">
  <li>simply put, one pair = one $\Pi_{c}$.</li>
</ol>

**X.** Exchange energy ($\Pi_{e}$): the lowering of energy from possible exchanges
between electrons with same energy and spin (why this lowers energy can
only be justified by advanced quantum mechanics)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The total exchange energy is calculated by $\textrm{K}_{tot} = \sum \frac{\textrm{n}(\textrm{n}-1)}{2} \prod_{\textrm{e}}$
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        two unpaired electrons $\frac{2 \times 1}{2} = 1 \prod_{e}$. three = $\frac{3 \times 2}{2} = 3 \prod_{e}$
      </li>
      <li>
        one Coulombic energy of repulsion and one exchange energy cancel out.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XI.** The two pairing terms ($\Pi_{c}$ and $\Pi_{e}$) add up to produce the total pairing energy:

$\prod = \prod_{c} + \prod_{e}$ (Eq. 19)
