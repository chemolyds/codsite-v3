## 2.6.1 Atomic radius

**I.** Atomic radius: half the distance between the centers of neighboring atoms

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Although there are no exact boundaries of electron clouds, the nuclei are
    found at definite distances from one another in solids and metals (bonding!)
  </li>
</ol>

**II.** Covalent radius: half the distance between the nuclei of atoms joined by a chemical bond (used
for nonmetal or metalloids).

**III.** van der Waals radius: half the distance between centers of neighboring atoms in a sample of the
solidified gas (used in monoatomic gases)

**IV.** Atomic radius generally decreases from left to right across a period and increases down a group

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    With each new period, the valence electrons occupy shells with increasing
    principal quantum number and therefore its electrons lie farther away from
    the nucleus
  </li>
  <li>
    As you go towards the right of the periodic table, the number of protons
    increases and therefore grasps the electrons more strongly, pulling them
    closer to the nucleus
  </li>
  <li>
    Across a period, $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$ dominates, and going down a group, n
    dominates.
  </li>
</ol>

**V.** Ionic radii trends are very similar to atomic radii

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    as electrons are added, the size of the ion increases as there are more
    electron-electron repulsions while having the same number of protons.
  </li>
  <li>
    as electrons are removed, the size of the ion decreases as there are less
    electron-electron repulsions while having the same number of protons.
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.6.2 Ionization Energy

**VI.** Ionization energy: the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion

$\textrm{A}^{\textrm{n}+}(\textrm{g}) \rightarrow \textrm{A}^{(\textrm{n}+1)+}(\textrm{g}) + \textrm{e}^{-}$

$\textrm{I} = \Delta \textrm{U}$

**VII.** Some of the common characteristics of first ionization energies of the periodic table are:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    High $\textrm{IE}_{1}$ for noble gases: $\textrm{ns}^{2}\textrm{np}^{6}$
    configurations are particularly stable and require more energy for an
    electron to be removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Very low $\textrm{IE}_{1}$ for Group I: removing one electron gives a noble
    gas configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be-B drop in $\textrm{IE}_{1}$: The np-electron is shielded by the
    ns-electrons and therefore easier to remove.
  </li>
  <li>
    N-O drop in $\textrm{IE}_{1}$: two electrons in the same orbital (paired
    electrons) leads to repulsion
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII.** Ionization energy measures how difficult it is to remove an electron; as effective nuclear charge
increases, the nuclei grips the electron more tightly and more energy is needed to take it out

**IX.** When an electron is removed, the shielding constant (S) decreases and therefore $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$ increases; as
a result, the cation size decreases holding the electrons tighter. Therefore, ionization energy
increases with each step.

## 2.6.3 Electron Affinity

**X.** Electron affinity: the energy released when an electron is added to a gas-phase atom

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Electron affinity have different variations of definitions that all mean the same thing:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Atkins: The definition shown above
      </li>
      <li>
        Miessler: The energy required to remove an electron from a negative anion
        $\textrm{A}^{-}(\textrm{g}) \rightarrow \textrm{A}(\textrm{g}) + \textrm{e}-$ where $\textrm{E}_{ea} = \Delta \textrm{U}$
      </li>
      <li>
        Housecroft: $-\Delta \textrm{U}$ for the gain of an electron by a gaseous atom (at 0 K)
        $\textrm{Y}(\textrm{g}) + \textrm{e}- \rightarrow \textrm{Y}^{-}(\textrm{g})$ where $\textrm{E}_{ea} = \Delta \textrm{U}$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    sometimes, the 1st electron affinity is referred to as the "zeroth ionization energy"
  </li>
  <li>
    when an electron is added to a neutral atom, most elements tend to release heat
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Exception: noble gases (disrupts full-shell stability) and alkaline earth metals
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Greater $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$ tends to release more energy when an electron is attached
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.6.4 Inert-Pair Effect and Diagonal Relationships

**XI.** Inert-Pair effect: the tendency to form ions two units lower in charge than expected from the group number

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The energy separation between ns and np orbitals increase down the group as s orbitals
    have much greater penetration compared to p orbitals
  </li>
  <li>
    Because ns orbitals are much lower in energy than np orbitals, electrons in the ns valence orbitals are not lost
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        In group 13, aluminum forms $\textrm{Al}^{3+}$ ions, while indium forms both $\textrm{In}^{3+}$ (rare) and $\textrm{In}^{+}$ ions.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XII.** Diagonal relationships: similarity in chemical properties among diagonal neighbors in the main
groups of the periodic table

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    lithium - magnesium: forms only normal oxides ($\textrm{O}^{2-}$), and reacts with nitrogen, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some other examples are beryllium - aluminum, boron - silicon, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
