# 2.6 Periodicity

---

## 2.6.1 Atomic radius

**I.** Atomic radius: half the distance between the centers of neighboring atoms

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Although there are no exact boundaries of electron clouds, the nuclei are
    found at definite distances from one another in solids and metals (bonding!)
  </li>
</ol>

**II.** Covalent radius: half the distance between the nuclei of atoms joined by a chemical bond (used
for nonmetal or metalloids).

**III.** van der Waals radius: half the distance between centers of neighboring atoms in a sample of the
solidified gas (used in monoatomic gases)

**IV.** Atomic radius generally decreases from left to right across a period and increases down a group

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    With each new period, the valence electrons occupy shells with increasing
    principal quantum number and therefore its electrons lie farther away from
    the nucleus
  </li>
  <li>
    As you go towards the right of the periodic table, the number of protons
    increases and therefore grasps the electrons more strongly, pulling them
    closer to the nucleus
  </li>
  <li>Across a period, Zeff dominates, and going down a group, n dominates.</li>
</ol>

**V.** Ionic radii trends are very similar to atomic radii

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    as electrons are added, the size of the ion increases as there are more
    electron-electron repulsions while having the same number of protons.
  </li>
  <li>
    as electrons are removed, the size of the ion decreases as there are less
    electron-electron repulsions while having the same number of protons.
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.6.2 Ionization Energy

**VI.** Ionization energy: the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion

$A^{n+}(g) \rightarrow A^{(n+1)+}(g) + e^{-}$

$I = \Delta U$

**VII.** Some of the common characteristics of first ionization energies of the periodic table are:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    High IE1 for noble gases: ns2np6 configurations are particularly stable and
    require more energy for an electron to be removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Very low IE1 for Group I: removing one electron gives a noble gas
    configuration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be-B drop in IE1: The np-electron is shielded by the ns-electrons and
    therefore easier to remove.
  </li>
  <li>
    N-O drop in IE1: two electrons in the same orbital (paired electrons) leads
    to repulsion
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII.** Ionization energy measures how difficult it is to remove an electron; as effective nuclear charge
increases, the nuclei grips the electron more tightly and more energy is needed to take it out

**IX.** When an electron is removed, the shielding constant (S) decreases and therefore Zeff increases; as
a result, the cation size decreases holding the electrons tighter. Therefore, ionization energy
increases with each step.

## 2.6.3 Electron Affinity

**X.** Electron affinity: the energy released when an electron is added to a gas-phase atom

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Electron affinity have different variations of definitions that all mean the same thing:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Atkins: The definition shown above
      </li>
      <li>
        Miessler: The energy required to remove an electron from a negative anion
        $A^{-}(g) \rightarrow A(g) + e-$ where $E_{ea} = \Delta U$
      </li>
      <li>
        Housecroft: $-\Delta U$ for the gain of an electron by a gaseous atom (at 0 K)
        $Y(g) + e- â†’ Y^{-}(g)$ where $E_{ea} = \Delta U$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    sometimes, the 1st electron affinity is referred to as the "zeroth ionization energy"
  </li>
  <li>
    when an electron is added to a neutral atom, most elements tend to release heat
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Exception: noble gases (disrupts full-shell stability) and alkaline earth metals
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Greater Zeff tends to release more energy when an electron is attached
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.6.4 Inert-Pair Effect and Diagonal Relationships

**XI.** Inert-Pair effect: the tendency to form ions two units lower in charge than expected from the group number

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The energy separation between ns and np orbitals increase down the group as s orbitals
    have much greater penetration compared to p orbitals
  </li>
  <li>
    Because ns orbitals are much lower in energy than np orbitals, electrons in the ns valence orbitals are not lost
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        In group 13, aluminum forms Al3+ ions, while indium forms both $In^{3+}$ (rare) and $In^{+}$ ions.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XII.** Diagonal relationships: similarity in chemical properties among diagonal neighbors in the main
groups of the periodic table

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    lithium - magnesium: forms only normal oxides ($O^{2-}$), and reacts with nitrogen, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some other examples are beryllium - aluminum, boron - silicon, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
