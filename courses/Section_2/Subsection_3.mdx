## 2.3.1 Wavefunction and its interpretations

**I** Wavefunction($\psi$): A mathematical function with values that vary with position.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    replacement of precise trajectories of a particle to account for
    wave-particle duality.
  </li>
  <li>
    Born interpretation: probability of finding a particle in a specific region
    is proportional to the value of $\psi$ in that region.
  </li>
  <li>
    Probability density ($\psi^{2}$): the probability of a particle to be found
    in a small region divided by the volume of the region.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>analogous to mass density: mass divided by volume</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    node: where the wavefunction passes through a value of zero
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        A position where there is zero probability of an electron to exist
      </li>
      <li>
        there are some debates on whether or not a node actually has zero
        probability
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**II.** Schrödinger equation: A mathematical equation used to calculate both the
wavefunction and its corresponding energy.

**III.** One of its solutions, referred to as time-independent Schrödinger equation
(TISE), for a particle moving in one dimension is: $- \frac{-ħ^{2}}{2m} \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂x^{2}} + V(x)\psi = E\psi$

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The terms $- \frac{-ħ^{2}}{2m} \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂x^{2}}$ represent kinetic energy, and V(x)ψrepresent potential energy.
    Together they are often referred to as the Hamiltonian of the system, written as $H\phi$.
  </li>
  <li>
    The total energy of a particle (E) equals the kinetic energy of the particle (T) and the
    potential energy of the particle (V); E = T + V.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because $T_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$, this can also be $T_{k} = \frac{p^{2}}{2m}$. Using Einstein's light quanta thesis (E = h\nu = ħ\omega), De Brogile's equation (Eq. 7), and some linear algebra, the kinetic
    energy term $- \frac{-ħ^{2}}{2m} \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂x^{2}}$ can be derived.
  </li>
  <li>
    the term $H\psi$ can be thought of as the total energy of the wavefunction $\psi$.
  </li>
</ol>

**IV.** The Schrodinger equation can be simplified further using the particle-in-a-box model.

## 2.3.2 The Quantization of Energy

---

**V.** A particle in a box: a simple one-dimensional box that confines a single particle with mass of m

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The particle exhibits wave-particle duality
  </li>
  <li>
    only certain wavelengths can exist in the box; must be half-periods
  </li>
  <li>
    The walls of the box has infinite potential energy, while inside it is zero
  </li>
  <li>
    The wavefunction for this particle-in-a-box is:

    $\psi\_{n}(x) = (\frac{2}{L^{\frac{1}{2}}} sin(\frac{n \pi x}{L}))$ (Eq. 9)

  </li>
</ol>

VI. quantum number: an integer or half-integer that labels a wavefunction that specifies a state or a
property.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The number n in a particle-in-a-box is an integer that labels the
    wavefunctions; higher n represents higher state of energy.
  </li>
</ol>

VII. Because n can only take on integer values, we can say that energy is quantized: energy is
restricted to a series of specific values called energy levels.

<ol type="a">
  <li>This applies to the three-dimensional world as well</li>
  <li>
    Note that the quantum mechanical description of energy has a defined
    "smallest amount of energy that can be transferred" but classical mechanics
    does not.
  </li>
  <li>
    An atom has similar quantized energy levels to a particle-in-a-box
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        its wavefunction has specific boundary constraints (conditions) similar
        to the particle-in-a-box model
      </li>
      <li>
        due to these constraints, only a few solutions of its Schrödinger
        equation and its corresponding energies exist.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

VIII. The equation $E_{k} = \frac{n^{2}h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}$ can be used to calculate the energy separation between two neighboring
levels with quantum numbers n and n + 1 using the equation:

$E_{n+1} - E_{n} = {(n + 1)^{2} - n^{2}} \frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}} = (2n + 1)\frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}$ (Eq. 11)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    As L (the length of the box) increases, the separation between neighboring energy level
    decreases
  </li>
  <li>
    As m (the pass of the particle) increases, the separation between neighboring energy
    level decreases
  </li>
  <li>
    As the lowest possible quantum number (n) is 1, the lowest possible energy is known as
    the zero-point energy and is $E_{k} = \frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}} ≈ 10^{-67}J$ (A particle cannot be perfectly still.)
  </li>
</ol>

Why is this important?

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The energy levels of the hydrogen atom are explained by this property. As
    you go up to higher energy levels in a Bohr model, the separation of energy
    levels decreases.
  </li>
  <li>
    In macroscopic environments, quantization is completely undetectable and is
    negligible; hence why classical mechanics work in most cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    The concept of zero-point energy is consistent with the uncertainty
    principle. A particle cannot possess zero energy as that would make the
    uncertainty of both the momentum and position of a particle also equal to
    zero, as it is not moving. This scenario defies the uncertainty principle
    and cannot happen.
  </li>
