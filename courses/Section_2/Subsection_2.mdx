# 2.2 Quantum Theory

---

The transition from classical physics to quantum physics were led by two scientific findings:

**I.** Blackbody radiation

**II.** Quanta and photoelectric effect

## 2.2.1 Radiation

---

**I.** Incandescence: the phenomenon in which a heated object begins to glow

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    As temperature increases, the intensity of the radiation from the object
    increases
  </li>
  <li>The color changes from red, to orange, to yellow, to white.</li>
</ol>

**II.** Blackbody: A body which does not favor absorbing or emitting a particular
wavelength

**III.** Blackbody radiation: radiation that is emitted at different wavelengths by a blackbody

**IV.** Two laws explain the properties of blackbody radiation:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Stefan-Boltzmann Law: (Total intensity) = $\sigma\crossT^{4}$</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Shows why as temperature increases, the intensity increases</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Wien's Law: constant = $λmax\crossT$ (Eq. 4)</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      $lambda$max is the wavelength of radiation that is emitted the most in a
      black body
    </li>
    <li>
      Proves why the color of emitting light changed as temperature changed
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
**V.** Classical physics could not properly explain the experimental results of blackbody
radiation

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Ultraviolet catastrophe: A classical physics prediction that for any hot
    body infinite energy is released
  </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      classical mechanics assumes that a certain amount of energy for
      electromagnetic radiation can oscillate at any wavelength, which is untrue
      $(E = hc\lambda)$
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
  <li>as the blackbody increases in temperature, λmax decreases.</li>
  <li>
    as the blackbody increases in temperature, the area under the curve (the
    total intensity) increases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because the wavelength of radiation does not determine its energy in
    classical physics, the intensity of light emitted only increases as the
    wavelength decreases, which is obviously not true
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.2.2 Quanta and Photoelectric Effect

---

**VI.** Quanta: packets of energy

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    proposed by Max Planck, stated that the exchange of energy between matter
    and radiation occurs in quanta (packets of energy)
  </li>
  <li>Energy could only be transferred in specific amounts (E = h\nu)</li>
  <li>
    the ultraviolet catastrophe will be avoided at low temperatures as there
    will be not enough energy to oscillate at a lower frequency
  </li>
  <li>
    Both Wien's Law and Stefan-Boltzmann law can be derived using Planck's law
  </li>
</ol>
**VII.** Photons: particles of light

**VIII.** The concept of quanta was confirmed by the photoelectric effect:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Electrons are not ejected if radiation is below a certain threshold frequency
  </li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This threshold frequency is known as the "work function" ($\phi$)
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>
    Electrons are ejected immediately regardless of intensity
  </li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li> 
        Intensity is not equivalent to energy; Intensity is the number of photons at an
        specific instance
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>
    The kinetic energy of the ejected electron(s) increase linearly with the frequency of
    radiation

    $\frac{1}{2} m_e \nu^2 = h\nu - \phi$ (Eq. 5)

  </li>
</ol>

**IX.** Bohr frequency condition:

$h\nu = E_{upper} - E_{lower}$ (Eq. 6)

<ol type="i">
  <li>
    Rydberg's formula for the hydrogen spectrum (Eq. 2) is derived from this
    equation.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
  <li>The slope of the function above is h.</li>
  <li>A work function is unique to every metal.</li>
  <li>
    Judging from periodic trends, it seems plausible that the work function is
    related to the atom's effective nuclear charge (Ref. 2.5.1)
  </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      The bigger the effective nuclear charge of the metal, the harder it is for
      the electron to eject.
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>

## 2.2.3 The Wave-Particle Duality of Matter

---

**X.** All particles possess both wave and particle properties.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Blackbody radiation is a wave property (frequency and wavelength are all
    wave-related)
  </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      In the wave model, intensity is proportional to $(amplitude of the wave)^
      {2}$
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>
    The photoelectric effect is a particle property (mass and speed are all
    particle-related)
  </li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      In the particle model, intensity is proportional to the number of photons
      present
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>

**XI.** Diffraction: pattern of high and low intensities generated by an object in the path of a ray of light

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Diffraction patterns have light spots (high intensity) and dark spots (low
    intensity)
  </li>
  <li>
    Constructive interference: peaks of waves coincide, enhancing the amplitude
    of the wave.
  </li>
  <li>
    Destructive interference: peaks and troughs of waves coincide, diminishes
    the wave, forming a node
  </li>
</ol>

**XII.** De Broglie relation: all particles have a wave-particle duality, including macroscopic objects

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The wave property is rarely significant with macroscopic objects. $\lambda =
    hp$ (Eq. 7)
  </li>
</ol>

## 2.2.4 The Uncertainty Principle

**XIII.** the precise location of a particle is unknown for microscopic objects due to its wave property

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A definite trajectory does not exist and therefore it is hard to predict its
    location
  </li>
</ol>

**XIV.** Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: the complementarity of location and momentum of a particle

$ΔpΔx ≥ \frac{1}{2}ħ$ (Eq. 8)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    uncertainty is negligible for macroscopic objects but significant for microscopic objects
  </li>
  <li>
    Note: ħ is called a "reduced Planck's constant”, and is equivalent to $\frac{1}{2\pi}$.
  </li>
</ol>
