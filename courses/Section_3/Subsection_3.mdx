# 3.3 Dipole Moments, Electronegativity, and Polarizability

---

## 3.3.1 Polarity

**I** All molecules can be viewed as resonance hybrids of purely covalent and ionic characters

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    homonuclear diatomic molecules: both atoms have the same
    electron-withdrawing power and therefore the covalent resonance structure
    makes the biggest contribution.

  </li>
  <li>
    heteronuclear diatomic molecules: one element has a greater
    electron-withdrawing power than the other and the ionic resonance structure
    makes a significant contribution.

  </li>
</ol>

**II** As a molecule has greater partial charge, it is said to have considerable ionic character.

**III** polar: when two atoms have different electron-withdrawing powers and electrons are drawn
closer towards the more electronegative atom

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    When a bond is polar, it is said to have an electric dipole moment
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        it is important to include 'electric' as there are other types as well
        (magnetic)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    For a X-Y diatomic molecule, the electric dipole moment is calculated by:
    $\mu = \textrm{q} \times \textrm{e} \times \textrm{d}$ (Eq.24)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Frequently reported in Debye (D); $1 \textrm{D} = 3.336 \times 10^{-30}
        \textrm{C} \times \textrm{m}$
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The more electronegative element of a polar bond has the negative partial
    charge.
  </li>
  <li>
    A dipole moment is a vector quantity; it has a direction and by SI
    convention, the arrow points from $\sigma -$ end of the bond to $\sigma +$
    end.

  </li>
</ol>

**IV** polarity is a molecular property; the net dipole moment is the sum of all vector quantities
of the individual dipoles

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Note: The molecular dipole moment cannot be accurately calculated with a
    simple addition of vectors; there are discrepancies between vector additions
    and experimental
  </li>
  <li>
    lone pairs significantly affect the value of $\mu$; if the resultant dipole
    moment acts in a direction that is reinforced by the lone pair, $\mu$
    increases.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the resultant dipole moment opposes the effects of the lone pair, $\mu$
    decreases.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Compare $\textrm{NH}_{3}$ and $\textrm{NF}_{3}$. Although $\delta\chi$
        is greater for N-F bond, net dipole moment is greater for $\textrm{NH}_
        {3}$ because N-H dipoles point towards lone pair.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 3.3.2 Electronegativity

**X** electronegativity, Pauling ($\chi^{P}$) difference of experimental bond enthalpy and bond enthalpy
calculated from additive rules
$\delta\chi = \chi^{P}(Y)-\chi^{P}(X) = \sqrt{\delta \textrm{D}}$ (Eq. 25)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    bond dissociation enthalpy (D, energy required to break a bond) can be roughly estimated
    using additive rules as shown in Eq. 7:
    $\textrm{D}(\textrm{X}-\textrm{Y}) = \frac{1}{2} \times [\textrm{D}(\textrm{X}-\textrm{X}) + \textrm{D}(\textrm{Y}-\textrm{Y})]$ (Eq. 26)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Eq. 7 is relatively accurate for nonpolar molecules (e.g. ClBr) but horrible for
        molecules with significant ionic character (e.g. HCl)
      </li>
      <li>
        Pauling assumed that this was because of the ionic contribution of the bond, as
        atoms had different electron-withdrawing powers.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    $\sqrt{\delta \textrm{D}} = \textrm{D}_{\textrm{experimental}} - \textrm{D}_{\textrm{calculated}}$; kJ is converted to eV to obtain a small numeric value
  </li>
  <li>
    Different oxidation states have different electron attracting powers; elements may have
    more than one $\chi^{P}$ value
  </li>
</ol>

**XI** electronegativity, Mulliken ($\chi^{M}$): the average of ionization energy ($\textrm{I}$) and electron affinity ($\textrm{EA}_{1}$)

<ol type="a">
  <li>An electronegativity value that is based on atomic properties</li>
</ol>

**XII** electronegativity, Allred-Rochow ($\chi^{AR}$): A measure of the electrostatic force exerted by $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$ on
the valence electron (basically, based on $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$)

$\chi^{AR} = (3590 \times \frac{\textrm{Z}_{eff}}{\textrm{r}^{2}_{cov}} + 0.744)$ (Eq. 27)

## 3.3.3 Polarizability

**XIII** polarizability ($\alpha$): A measure of the ease with which the electron cloud of a molecule can be
distorted

<ol type="a">
  <li>species that are electron rich and heavy tend to be more polarizable</li>
</ol>

**XIV** polarizing power: A measure of the ease with which an atom can distort the electron cloud of
another atom.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    species that are small with high charge tends to have greater polarizing
    power
  </li>
  <li>
    A compound composed of small, highly charged cation (strong polarizing
    power) and large, polarizable anion tends to have bonds with considerable
    covalent character.
  </li>
</ol>

## 3.3.4 Bond Strengths and Bond Lengths

**I** dissociation energy (D): the energy required to separate the bonded atoms completely

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    it is the energy required to acquire a homolytic cleavage of a bond like
    shown below: $\textrm{H}-\textrm{Cl} = \cdot \textrm{H}(\textrm{g}) + \cdot
    \textrm{Cl}(\textrm{g})$
  </li>
</ol>

**II** Dissociation energy is representative of the strength of each bond

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The dissociation energy for Câ‰¡C bonds is a lot less than 3 C-C bonds (Ref.
    Figure 23)
  </li>
  <li>
    the repulsion between lone pairs can also weaken the bonding (e.g. F2)
  </li>
</ol>

**III** bond length: distance between the centers of two atoms joined by a covalent bond

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the length of the bond is the distance when the potential energy of the
    molecule is minimum (Ref. Figure 23)
  </li>
  <li>
    bond length correlates to bond strength; the stronger the bond, the shorter
    the bond.
  </li>
  <li>
    multiple bonds (with additional bonding electrons) attracts the nuclei more
    strongly and pulls the atoms closer together
