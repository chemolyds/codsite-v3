# 3.4 VSEPR Theory and LCP Theory

## 3.4.1 VSEPR Theory

**I** VSEPR Theory: A model that predicts the geometry from the electron pairs that surround the
center of the molecule.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Adopts a molecular geometry that minimizes electron repulsions between
    electron pairs.
  </li>
  <li>works best for simple halides of the p-block elements</li>
  <li>
    its biggest flaw is that it does not consider the steric factors of the
    molecule, such as the size of its substituents.
  </li>
</ol>

**II** Four conditions determine the geometry of a molecule in the VSEPR model:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Each valence shell electron pair of the central atom E in $\textrm{EX}_{n}$
    is stereochemically significant (contributes to the geometry of the overall
    molecule).
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        both bonding (single, double, triple) and lone pairs will determine the
        overall geometry of the molecule in an arrangement that minimizes
        repulsions.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Electron-electron repulsions decrease in the sequence of: lone pair-lone
    pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        To minimize repulsions, lone pair-lone pair angles will be maximized.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Bonding pair-bonding pair repulsions also decrease in the sequence of:
    triple bond-single bond > double bond-single bond > single bond-single bond.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repulsions between the bonding pairs in $\textrm{EX}_{n}$ depend on the
    difference in electronegativities of E and X.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Electron-electron repulsions are weaker if the electron density of the
        E-X bond is drawn away from the central atom (electronegative
        substituent)
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversely, electron-electron repulsions are stronger if the electron
        density of the E-X bond is closer towards the central atom
        (electropositive substituent)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**III** The approximated angles by the VSEPR model are most accurate when the substituents
(X) are identical with no lone pairs. Refer to common geometries (see “AXE
method”)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Distortion may occur if the substituents are different or presence of lone pairs.
  </li>
  <li>
    stereochemical inert-pair effect: the tendency of s-valence electrons adopting
    a non-bonding role 
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This effect is mostly found in 7-coordinate species such as $[\textrm{SeCl}_{6}]^{2-}$ or $[\textrm{TeCl}_{6}]^{2-}$
        that adopt octahedral structures
      </li>
      <li>
        n-coordinate species refer to n pairs of electrons of the center atom.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**IV** The VSEPR model should NEVER be applied for d-block electron configurations of
transition metal compounds!

**V** 5-coordinate species and 7-coordinate species are special as they have two different
bond lengths

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The two bond types are axial and equatorial (Ref. Figure 24)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        for 5-coordinate species, axial positions possess more $90 \degree$
        repulsions than equatorial positions and therefore electronegative
        elements are placed in axial positions while lone pairs are placed in
        equatorial positions to minimize repulsions.
      </li>
      <li>
        If all substituents are the same, axial bonds are longer than equatorial
        bonds due to larger repulsion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversely for 7-coordinate species, equatorial positions possess more
        strained ($72\degree$) repulsions than axial positions, and therefore
        placements are reversed.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 3.4.2 LCP Model

**VI** The Ligand Close Packing model utilizes distances between substituents in molecules as a guide
to molecular shapes.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    distances between two close substituents (that are not directly bonded to each other) are
    relatively constant even if bond angles and lengths change (based on experimental data)
  </li>
  <li>
    unlike the VSEPR model that focuses on the central atom, the LCP
    model focuses on substituents.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Therefore, the LCP model is used in conjunction with the
        VSEPR model.
      </li>
    </ol>  
  </li>
  <li>
    the two species $\textrm{NF}_{4}^{+}$ and $\textrm{NF}_{3}$ is shown in Figure 25
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** Final word on VSEPR and LCP models:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A single bond to an electropositive substituent has electron density closer
    to the center of the molecule than a single bond to an electronegative
    substituent.
  </li>
  <li>
    If electron density is further away from the center, there are less
    repulsions and able to adopt geometries with smaller angles between
    substituents. The opposite is also true.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although the VSEPR model illustrated the reasoning behind geometries of many
    species, it did not explain the nature of bonding.
  </li>
</ol>
