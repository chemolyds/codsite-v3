# 3.5. Modern Bonding Theories

---

## 3.5.1 Valence Bonding Theory

**I** Valence Bond Theory (VBT): A theory that considers the interactions between separate atomic
orbitals as they are brought to form molecules

<ol type="a">
  <li>it is a description of covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbitals</li>
  <li>
    takes into consideration the wave property of electrons and the uncertainty
    principle
  </li>
  <li>
    the valence bond theory is still a localized model as the electron density
    is predicted to be between atoms
  </li>
</ol>

**II** There are two types of bonding classified by the VBT:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $\sigma$-bonding: the overlap of one region on the internuclear axis between
    two atomic orbitals (Ref. Figure 26)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the greater the overlap of the atomic orbitals, the stronger the bond
      </li>
      <li>all single bonds in the VBT are classified as $\sigma$-bonds</li>
      <li>
        other orbitals such as 2s or $2\textrm{p}_{z}$ orbitals can also form
        $\sigma$-bonds.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    $\pi$-bonding: the overlap of two regions between two atomic orbitals (Ref.
    Figure 27)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>contains a single nodal plane in the internuclear axis</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    When there are multiple bonds, $\pi$-bonding and $\sigma$-bonding are both
    used:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>for single bonds, it is only one $\sigma$-bond.</li>
      <li>for double bonds, it is one $\sigma$-bond and one $\pi$-bond.</li>
      <li>for triple bonds, it is one $\sigma$-bond and two $\pi$-bonds.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**III** Hybridization: a linear combination of atomic orbitals to account for observed geometry

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    electron promotion occurs in the first step of hybridization
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        for methane ($\textrm{CH}_{4}$), one 2s electron is placed to an empty
        2p orbital forming four unpaired electrons
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    following electron promotion, the atomic orbitals merge into hybrid orbitals
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        hybrid orbitals result from the constructive and destructive
        interference of atomic orbitals (Ref. Figure 28)
      </li>
      <li>
        these hybrids are degenerate in energy but in different orientations
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 3.5.2 Types of Hybridization

**IV** There are many different types of hybridization:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $\textrm{sp}^{3}$ hybridization: three p orbitals and one s orbital combine
    to form four equivalent $\textrm{sp}^{3}$ hybrid orbitals:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>each hybrid orbital has 75% p character and 25% s character</li>
      <li>
        each $\textrm{sp}^{3}$ orbital has two lobes with a massive size
        inequality
      </li>
      <li>
        as electron density is concentrated on one side of the nucleus, more
        efficient overlap can be achieved and stronger bonds are formed compared
        to absence of hybridization
      </li>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hdiVKCX.png" />
      <li>
        the resulting geometry for $\textrm{sp}^{3}$ hybrid orbitals is
        tetrahedral
      </li>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/N45Nfp8.png" />
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    $\textrm{sp}^{2}$ hybridization: two p orbitals and one s orbital combine to
    form three equivalent $\textrm{sp}^{2}$ hybrid orbitals:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>each hybrid orbital has 66% p character and 33% s character</li>
      <li>
        each $\textrm{sp}^{2}$ has two lobes with a large size inequality (but
        not as much as $\textrm{sp}^{3}$)
      </li>
      <li>
        $\textrm{sp}^{2}$ hybridization leaves behind one p orbital; trigonal
        planar geometry
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9q2P196.png" />
  </li>
  <li>
    sp hybridization: one p orbital and one s orbital combine to form two
    equivalent sp hybrid orbitals:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>each hybrid orbital has 50% p character and 50% s character</li>
      <li>each sp orbital has two lobes with a much smaller size inequality</li>
      <li>sp hybridization leaves behind two p orbitals; linear geometry</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    other theorical hybridizations such as $\textrm{sp}^{3}\textrm{d}^{2}$ and
    $\textrm{sp}^{3}\textrm{d}$ exist
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        usage of these hybrid orbitals to justify electron promotion and
        defiance of the octet rule can be prevented with charge-separated
        species (Ref. Figure 30/31)
      </li>
      <li>
        ab initio data reveals that d orbital participation is very small for
        these molecules
      </li>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DiHPEP7.png" />
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**V** The valence bond theory has a few flaws:

<ol type="a">
  <li>it is still a localized model</li>
  <li>
    hybridization of more complex orbitals such as $\textrm{sp}^{3}\textrm{d}^
    {2}$ and $\textrm{sp}^{3}\textrm{d}$ leads to violation of the octet rule
    which does not match observations
  </li>
  <li>cannot describe the paramagnetic property of dioxygen.</li>
  <li>
    many period 3 elements such as sulfur and phosphorus do not follow match
    hybridization bond angles and observations due to poor orbital overlap
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** Despite its flaws, the valence bond theory is still used in conjunction with the molecular orbital
theory, due to the convenience and simplicity that hybridization provides.

## 3.5.3 Molecular Orbital Theory

**VII** Molecular Orbital Theory (MO Theory): A theory that considers all electrons to be delocalized
throughout the entire molecule

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Molecular orbitals: regions of space (wavefunctions) that an electron may
    occupy throughout a molecule
  </li>
  <li>
    a molecular orbital is formed from the linear combination of atomic orbitals
    (LCAO).
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** when two atomic orbitals (such as 1s) combine, two molecular orbitals form

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    a bonding molecular orbital is formed when constructive interference (Ref.
    Figure 34) of the atomic orbitals occur
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/peRLB8L.png" />
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        this interaction reinforces each other and electron density is high
        between the two atomic nuclei
      </li>
      <li>
        this buildup of electron density between the nuclei reduces internuclear
        repulsion
      </li>
      <li>
        because the electron occupies a greater volume, it has lower kinetic
        energy
      </li>
      <li>
        because the electron is attracted by two nuclei, it has lower potential
        energy
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    an antibonding molecular orbital is formed when destructive interference
    (Ref. Figure 35) of the atomic orbitals occur
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9nQkxl.png" />
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        this interaction results in a nodal plane with zero electron density
        between the two atomic nuclei
      </li>
      <li>
        this lack of electron density raises internuclear repulsion and
        destabilizes the molecular orbital
      </li>
      <li>
        the magnitude of energy raised from antibonding orbitals is larger than
        the magnitude of energy lowered from bonding orbitals.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <u>Do not forget:</u> (total # of molecular orbitals) = (total # of atomic
    orbitals used)
  </li>
</ol>

**IX** A molecular orbital energy-level diagram is constructed to illustrate the relative energies of the
atomic orbitals and the molecular orbitals.

<ol type="a">
  <li>electrons are added according to the Aufbau principle.</li>
</ol>

**X** Bond order (h): the net number of bonds with consideration of antibonding interactions
$\textrm{b} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\textrm{N}_{e}-\textrm{N}^{*}_{e})$ (Eq. 28)

<ol type="a">
  <li>an asterisk (*) is commonly used to indicate antibonding</li>
  <li>
    $\textrm{N}_{e}$ illustrates the number of electrons in a bonding orbital.
  </li>
  <li>
    bond order can often be correlated with bond distances and bond dissociation
    energies
  </li>
</ol>

**XI.** A basis set of orbitals are atomic orbitals that are available for orbital interactions

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    for $\textrm{p}_{z}$ orbitals, only direct overlap is possible and forms $\sigma$ and
    $\sigma^{*}$ orbitals
  </li>
  <li>
    for $\textrm{p}_{x}$ and $\textrm{p}_{y}$ orbitals, only sideways overlap is possible; forms
    $\pi$ and $\pi^{*}$ orbitals
  </li>
  <li>
    because $\pi$-orbitals are less efficient at bonding then $\sigma$-orbitals,
    they are higher in energy.
  </li>
</ol>

**XII.** Compounds can be classified according to their behavior in a magnetic field:

<ol type="a">
  <li>diamagnetic substances tend to move out of a magnetic field</li>
  <li>paramagnetic substances tend to move into a magnetic field</li>
</ol>

**XIII.** A list of the second period homonuclear diatomics:

| Diatomic Species  | Electronic Configuration                                                    | Bond Order | Diamagnetic, paramagnetic | Desription                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\textrm{H}_{2}$  | $\sigma_{g}^{2}(1\textrm{s})$                                               | 1          | Diamagnetic               | A single $\sigma$ orbital that contains an electron pair.                  |
| $\textrm{He}_{2}$ | $\sigma_{g}^{2}\sigma_{u}^{*2}(1\textrm{s})$                                | 0          | Diamagnetic               | There is no net bonding interaction so this species is extremely unstable. |
| $\textrm{Li}_{2}$ | $\sigma_{g}^{2}(2\textrm{s})$                                               | 1          | Diamagnetic               | this is in agreement with observation of gas-phase $Li_{2}$ molecules.     |
| $\textrm{Be}_{2}$ | $\sigma_{g}^{2}\sigma_{u}^{*2}(2\textrm{s})$                                | 0          | Diamagnetic               | As expected, this species is also extremely unstable.                      |
| $\textrm{B}_{2}$  | $\pi_{u}^{1}\pi_{u}^{1}(2\textrm{p})$                                       | 1          | Paramagnetic              | paramagnetic due to s-p orbital mixing (See below)                         |
| $\textrm{C}_{2}$  | $\pi_{u}^{2}\pi_{u}^{2}(2\textrm{p})$                                       | 2          | Diamagnetic               | oddly enough does not possess any $\sigma$ bonds                           |
| $\textrm{N}_{2}$  | $\pi_{u}^{2}\pi_{u}^{2}\sigma_{g}^{2}(2\textrm{p})$                         | 3          | Diamagnetic               | very stable triple bond                                                    |
| $\textrm{O}_{2}$  | $\sigma_{g}^{2}\pi_{u}^{2}\pi_{u}^{2}\pi_{g}^{*1}\pi_{g}^{*1}(2\textrm{p})$ | 2          | Paramagnetic              | the energy levels changed due to $\sigma-\pi$ crossover                    |
| $\textrm{F}_{2}$  | $\sigma_{g}^{2}\pi_{u}^{2}\pi_{u}^{2}\pi_{g}^{*2}\pi_{g}^{*2}(2\textrm{p})$ | 1          | Diamagnetic               | weak bond so hard to find as a diatomic                                    |

**XIV.** As $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$ increases across the second period, the energy of atomic orbitals decreases

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    as 2s orbitals have much higher penetration than 2p orbitals, the separation
    of energy levels between 2s and 2p increases across the period (Ref.
    Figure_38)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        for molecules like $\textrm{O}_{2}$ and $\textrm{F}_{2}$, the energy
        separation between 2s and 2p were great enough that their interactions
        could be ignored
      </li>
      <li>
        for molecules like $\textrm{B}_{2}$ to $\textrm{N}_{2}$, the energy
        separation is small enough for orbital mixing to occur
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    orbital mixing: the interaction of molecular orbitals of similar symmetry
    and energy
  </li>
  <li>
    $\sigma-\pi$ crossover: the change in energy diagram positions of $\sigma_
    {g}(2\textrm{p})$ and $\pi_{u}(2\textrm{p})$
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        both $\textrm{B}_{2}$ and $\textrm{O}_{2}$ are paramagnetic due to this
        $\sigma-\pi$ crossover
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iZrUvhc.png" />

**XV.** The following three conditions will determine the formation of molecular orbitals for
heteronuclear molecular orbitals:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    formation is allowed if symmetries of atomic orbitals are compatible
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        if symmetries do not match, this is known as symmetry-disallowed
        interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        if symmetry-disallowed, the overlap integral is zero and therefore no
        energy gain.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    formation is efficient if region of overlap between two atomic orbitals is
    significant.
  </li>
  <li>
    formation is efficient if atomic orbitals are relatively close in energy.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the ionic bonding model represents the scenario where the separation of
        energy between two atomic orbitals is so big that there is barely any
        orbital interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        the covalent bonding model represents the scenario where the separation
        of energy between two atomic orbitals is so little that there is maximum
        orbital interaction.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVI.** The linear combination of atomic orbitals to form diatomic molecules can be described
mathematically:

$\psi = \textrm{c}_{A}\psi_{A} + \textrm{c}_{B}\psi_{B}$ (Eq. 29)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    for homonuclear diatomic molecules, the coefficients $\textrm{c}_{A}$ and
    $\textrm{c}_{B}$ are equal.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        In other words, equal contributions are made by both atomic orbitals.
      </li>
      <li>this resembles a pure nonpolar bond.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    for heteronuclear diatomic molecules, the coefficients $\textrm{c}_{A}$ and
    $\textrm{c}_{B}$ are not equal.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        In other words, nonequal contributions are made by the two atomic
        orbitals.
      </li>
      <li>
        this resembles a polar bond. If extreme, it can resemble an ionic bond.
      </li>
      <li>
        if coefficients $\textrm{c}_{A}^{2}$ is large for a certain molecular
        orbital, this molecular orbital should resemble atomic orbital A with
        electron density closer to A.
      </li>
      <li>
        if coefficients $\textrm{c}_{B}^{2}$ is large for a certain molecular
        orbital, this molecular orbital should resemble atomic orbital B with
        electron density closer to B.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVII.** As shown in Figure 39, the bonding orbital is significantly closer in energy to the atomic orbital
that is lower in energy than the one that is higher in energy.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aRnGKas.png" />

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Because more electronegative atoms (higher $\textrm{Z}_{eff}$) have lower
    energy levels, the following can be justified:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        the bonding orbital will have significantly more character of the
        electronegative element's atomic orbital that is lower in energy
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversely, the antibonding orbital will have significantly more
        character of the electropositive element's atomic orbital that is higher
        in energy
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVIII.** For molecular orbitals with more than two atoms, it is much more difficult to
predict energy levels of molecular orbitals; a character table or a computer
software is required.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    This is also true for heteronuclear diatomic orbitals with elements that
    have atomic numbers greater than 8.
  </li>
</ol>
