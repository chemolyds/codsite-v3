# 3.2 Chemical Bonds

---

## 3.2.1 Atomic radius

**I.** ionic model: a description of chemical bonding in terms of ions

**II.** ionic solid: an assembly of cations and anions stacked together in a regular array

**III** Ionic solids are hard, rigid (does not bend), and often brittle (forms cracks)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    multiple cations and anions are bonded together by electrostatic force
    (forces resulting from opposite charges) and therefore is rigid and is hard
    to remove individual ions
  </li>
  <li>
    When sudden force is applied, the cations that used to touch the anions can
    now touch with the cations, which leads to an electrostatic repulsion.
    (accounts for brittleness)
  </li>
</ol>

**IV** Ionic solids often are electric conductors in solution (electrolyte) or as a liquid (melt) state

**V** lattice energy: the difference in energy between the state of separated gaseous cations and anions
and the state as an ionic solid

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    a Born-Haber cycle is used to calculate the lattice energy of an ionic solid
    (Ref. Figure 19)
  </li>
  <li>
    You can imagine formation of the solid from its neutral gaseous components
    in 3 steps:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>gaseous metal atoms release electrons, forming cations.</li>
      <li>
        The released electrons attach to gaseous nonmetal atoms, forming anions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The gaseous cations and anions clump together as a crystalline solid.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ionic bonding is favorable if the final state (ionic compound) is more
    favorable in energy than its initial state (separate ions)
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** Ionic bonding is a global interaction that is a characteristic of the entire crystal.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    all anions attract all cations, and like ions repel all like ions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The interaction of two individual ions can be expressed quantitatively using Coulomb's
    potential energy:
    $\textrm{E}_{p,12} = \frac{(\textrm{z}_{1}\textrm{e})(\textrm{z}_{2}\textrm{e})}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \textrm{r}_{12}}$ (Eq. 20)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        $\textrm{z}_{1}\textrm{e}$ and $\textrm{z}_{2}\textrm{e}$ represent the magnitude of charges for a cation and an anion
      </li>
      <li>
        $\textrm{r}_{12}$ represents the distance between the two ions
      </li>
      <li>
        $ \epsilon $ (epsilon) is the permittivity; its value depends on the nature of the medium
        between the charges, such as air, water, or oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        The vacuum permittivity ($\epsilon_{0}$) is the permittivity when the medium is a vacuum.
      </li>
      <li>
        illustrates that if the distance between the two ions decrease or if the magnitude
        of charge of either of the ions increase, the interaction becomes stronger.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If the global interaction property of ionic bonding is taken into account (like in crystalline
    solids), the molar potential energy of a one-dimensional is:
    $\textrm{E}_{p} = -\textrm{A} \times \frac{\textrm{N}_{A} \textrm{z}^{2} \textrm{e}^{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \textrm{d}}$ (Eq. 21)
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          Madelung constant (A): a numerical value that depends on arrangement of ions.
        </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** As illustrated in Figure 1, as the separation (d) between ions increases, the potential energy
decreases until repulsive forces dominate where the potential energy rises exponentially

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The Born-Mayer Equation calculates the minimum potential energy shown in Figure 18:
    $\textrm{E}_{p,min} = -\textrm{A} \times \frac{\textrm{N}_{A}||\textrm{z}_{1}\textrm{z}_{2}||}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} \textrm{d}} (1 - \frac{\textrm{d}*}{\textrm{d}})$ (Eq.22)
  </li>
  <li>
    d* is a constant dependent on the compressibility of the crystal.
  </li>
</ol>

## 3.2.2 Covalent Bonding

**I** covalent bond: a pair of electrons shared between two atoms

**II** coordinate covalent bond: when both electrons come from a single atom.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Note that this type of bonding is no different from a normal covalent bond.
  </li>
  <li>Coordinate covalent bonds are also known as dative covalent bonds.</li>
</ol>

**III** Octet rule: atoms bond together to complete a full shell by sharing electron pairs

**IV** There are several "tips" in predicting the molecular arrangement of a given chemical formula:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    _In general,_ the central atom tends to be the element with the lowest
    ionization energy.
  </li>
  <li>
    _When desperate_, try arranging the atoms symmetrically around the central
    atom.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        This rule has many exceptions, such as $\textrm{N}_{2}\textrm{O}$
        ($\textrm{NNO}$).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**V** resonance: the blending of structures

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    resonance structure: one way to represent a molecule in terms of Lewis
    structures
  </li>
  <li>
    resonance hybrid: the blend of resonance structures represents the actual
    molecule
  </li>
  <li>
    A set of rules that determines the contribution of each resonance structure
    is:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Each contributing structure must have its nuclei in the same positions
      </li>
      <li>
        Structures with the same energy contribute equally to the resonance
      </li>
      <li>low-energy structures contribute more than high-energy structures</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** Formal charge: the charge of an atom assuming that all electrons are shared equally

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    it is calculated by (V = valence electrons, L = lone pair e-, B = bonding
    pair e-) Formal charge = $\textrm{V} - (\textrm{L} + \frac{1}
    {2} \textrm{B})$ (Eq. 23)
  </li>
  <li>formal charge exaggerates the covalent character of bonding</li>
  <li>
    The Lewis structure with formal charges closest to zero for all of its atoms
    in the molecule represents the lowest energy arrangement of atoms and
    electrons.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        For a molecule of water ($\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{O}$), oxygen has $6 -
        (4+2) = 0$.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** Oxidation number: the charge on an atom assuming that the more electronegative atom
possesses all of the electrons in a bond

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    For a molecule of water ($\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{O}$), oxygen has $6 - 8 =
    -2$.
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** radical: species having electrons with unpaired spins

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    tends to be unstable and frequently causes chain reactions due to unpaired
    electrons
  </li>
  <li>
    antioxidant: reacts rapidly with radicals to prevent further radical
    reactions
  </li>
  <li>biradical: a molecule with two unpaired electrons</li>
</ol>

**IX** There are many exceptions to the octet rule:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Most reactive intermediates do not obey the octet rule.</li>
  <li>
    Hypervalent molecules: A molecule which the center atom possesses more than
    eight electrons (an expanded valence shell)
  </li>
</ol>

**X** expanded valence shell: when the central atom expands its octet and accommodates more than
eight electrons. Conditions for an “expanded valence shell” is:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The central atom must be sufficiently big enough to accommodate higher
    coordination.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Period 2 elements are too small to have more than four bonding spaces
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The central atom must have access to its d-orbitals.</li>
  <li>
    the electronegativity of ligands (substituents) is also important
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        $\textrm{PH}_{5}$ doesn't exist but $\textrm{PCl}_{15}$ does; the
        ligands must be electronegative enough to make sure the central atom
        does not have too high electron density
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
