# 3.1 Intro

---

**I** Bonding between two atoms lowers the potential energy of the two atoms

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Bond strength correlates to how much potential energy of the atoms is
    lowered from bonding.
  </li>
</ol>

**II** There are different types of bonding that occurs among molecules:

<ol type="a">
  <li>ionic bonding (metal − nonmetal)</li>
  <li>covalent bonding (nonmetal − nonmetal)</li>
  <li>metallic bonding (metal – metal)</li>
</ol>
