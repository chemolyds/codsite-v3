## 7.4.1 Fundamentals

**I** Oxidation: the process of losing one or more electrons.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Oxidation is often related to the process of gaining oxygen or losing hydrogen atoms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Oxidizing reagent (oxidant): the compound that is being reduced.
  </li>
</ol>

**II** Reduction: the process of gaining one or more electrons.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Reduction is often related to the process of losing oxygen or gaining hydrogen atoms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reducing reagent (reductant): the compound that is being oxidized.
  </li>
</ol>

**III** Both oxidation and reduction must occur at the same time (conservation of charge).

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Something must be reduced in order for something to be oxidized.
  </li>
  <li>
    Something must be oxidized in order for something to be reduced.
  </li>
</ol>

## 7.4.2 Electrochemistry and Electrolysis

**IV** electrolytic cell: a nonspontaneous redox reaction is forced to occur by applying work.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    this work is done by the surroundings as electric work.
  </li>
</ol>

**V** galvanic cell: a spontaneous redox reaction occurs and generates an electrical current.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    in the galvanic cell, the electric work is done by the system.
  </li>
</ol>

**VI** anode (-): the electrode at which oxidation takes place; electrons are released.

**VII** cathode (+): the electrode at which reduction takes place; electrons are accepted.

**VIII** electrolyte: ionically conducting medium, which carries an electric current (electrons)

**IX** electrodes: metallic conductors that are in contact with an electrolyte.

**X** cell potential ($\textrm{E}_{cell}$): The potential difference associated with a galvanic cell that is working
reversibly

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the cell potential illustrates how much work a galvanic cell can do
  </li>
  <li>
    a negative cell potential will illustrate that work would have to be done on the
    surroundings for the reaction to proceed (as it corresponds to a positive $\Delta \textrm{G}$)
  </li>
  <li>
    If the chemical equation is multiplied by a factor, $\textrm{E}_{cell}$ is not affected
  </li>
  <li>
    the standard cell potential ($\textrm{E}_{cell}\degree$) is defined by the standard Gibbs free energy of the reaction
    $\Delta \textrm{G} = -\textrm{nFE}_{cell}$ (Eq. 120)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        similar to $\Delta \textrm{G}$, $\textrm{E}_{cell}$ illustrates the cell potential between the products and reactants
        that they have at an intermediate stage of the reaction and have many possible
        values ($\Delta \textrm{G} = \Delta \textrm{G}\degree + \textrm{RT} \textrm{ln}(\textrm{Q})$)
      </li>
      <li>
        similar to $\Delta \textrm{G}\degree$, $\textrm{E}_{cell}\degree$ illustrates the cell potential between isolated products and
        reactants in their standard states and only has one unique value per reaction.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XI** The equilibrium constant of redox reactions can be calculated through $\Delta \textrm{G}_{r}\degree = -\textrm{RT}\textrm{ln}(\textrm{K})$:

$\textrm{ln}(\textrm{K}) = \frac{\textrm{n}_{r}\textrm{FE}_{cell}\degree}{\textrm{RT}}$ (Eq. 121)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    An extremely useful equation, illustrates that:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        a reaction with a large, positive $\textrm{E}_{cell}\degree$ will result in a large K
      </li>
      <li>
        a reaction with a large, negative $\textrm{E}_{cell}\degree$ will result in a small K
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XII** Electrochemical series illustrates the reactivity of species in order of their standard potentials

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    If the standard potential of a reduction half-reaction is very positive, its oxidized form is
    strongly oxidizing
  </li>
  <li>
    If the standard potential of a reduction half-reaction is very negative, its reduced form is
    strongly reducing
  </li>
</ol>

**XIII** In a galvanic cell, oxidation will occur at the anode, pushing electrons into the cathode, where
reduction will occur (Ref. Figure 80)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    a porous wall prevents any charge buildup from occurring by allowing electrolyte
    solutions to move between the two compartments
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        without it, charge buildup will cause the reaction to cease
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    salt bridge: similar to a porous wall, a gel containing a concentrated aqueous salt
    solution in an inverted U-tube that allows a flow of ions (completing the circuit)
  </li>
  <li>
    each “compartment” with an electrode is formally known as a half-cell
  </li>
</ol>

**XIV** cell diagram: a notation that expresses the structure of a cell

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    an example for the Daniell cell is given below:
    $\textrm{Zn}$ (s) | $\textrm{Zn}^{2+}$ (aq) || $\textrm{Cu}^{2+}$ (aq) | $\textrm{Cu}$ (s)
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        a salt bridge is illustrated with a double vertical line (||)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    When gases are involved in a redox reaction, platinum or any other inert electrode is
    utilized. An example is $\textrm{H}_{2}$(g).
  </li>
  <li>
    Any inert metallic component of an electrode is written as the outermost component of
    that electrode in the cell diagram
  </li>
  <li>
    commonly, the right-hand electrode in the diagram usually represents to be the site of
    reduction (cathode) and the left-hand electrode is the site of oxidation (anode).
  </li>
</ol>

**XV** the standard potential ($\textrm{E}\degree$) is the difference between the standard potentials of the two
electrodes

$\textrm{E}_{cell}\degree = \textrm{E}_{R}\degree - \textrm{E}_{L}\degree$ (Eq. 122)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    R stands for the right hand of the cell diagram (cathode), L stands for left
  </li>
  <li>
    the contribution of a single half-cell can be calculated with respect to a standard
    hydrogen electrode (SHE), which
    
    $\textrm{E}\degree$ ($\frac{\textrm{H}^{+}}{\textrm{H}_{2}}) = 0$ at all temperatures
  </li>
  <li>
    for example, when measuring the standard potential of copper:

    $\textrm{Cu}^{2+}(\textrm{aq}) + \textrm{H}_{2}(\textrm{g}) \rightarrow
    \textrm{Cu}(\textrm{s}) + 2 \textrm{H}^{+}(\textrm{aq})$

    $\textrm{E}_{cell}\degree = \textrm{E}_{R}\degree - \textrm{E}_{L}\degree = \textrm{E}_{R}\degree$
  </li>
  <li>
    caution for using Eq. 122: when different numbers of electrons are involved in half-
    reactions for the same element, you must combine the values of $\Delta \textrm{G}\degree$ instead of adding
    the cell potential together
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        in fact, Eq. 122 is derived using the additive properties of Gibbs free energy
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XVII** Nernst equation: an equation that illustrates the cell potential at nonstandard conditions

$\textrm{E}_{cell} = \textrm{E}_{cell}\degree - \frac{\textrm{RT}}{\textrm{n}_{r}\textrm{F}} \textrm{ln}(\textrm{Q})$ (Eq. 123)

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    $\textrm{F}$ is Faraday's constant; $\textrm{n}_{r}$ stands for the number of moles of electrons involved in the
    reaction; $\textrm{Q}$ is the reaction quotient.
  </li>
  <li>
    When $\textrm{E}_{cell} = 0$ in which the system has reached equilibrium, $\textrm{Q} = \textrm{K}$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used to illustrate the cell potential at a given composition of the reaction mixture
  </li>
</ol>

**XX** In an electrolytic cell, a current must be supplied externally and forces oxidation to occur at the
anode and reduction to occur at the cathode.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    overpotential is required, which is experimentally determined and greater than the
    calculated cell potential, to achieve a significant rate of product formation in electrolysis
  </li>
  <li>
    the number of electrons (in moles) from an external current can be calculated by:
    $\textrm{n} = \frac{\textrm{It}}{\textrm{F}}$ (Eq. 124)
  </li>
  <li>
    I stand for current (in Amperes), t stands for time (in seconds), and F is a constant
  </li>
</ol>
