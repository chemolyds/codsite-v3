## 7.5.1 Hard-soft Acid-base (HSAB) Theory

**I** HSAB is one of the most useful qualitative theories in chemistry, can be used to predict a wide
variety of reactions such as:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Qualitative Analysis
  </li>
  <li>
    Solubility reactions
  </li>
  <li>
    Organic reactions
  </li>
</ol>

**II** Note that HSAB is only a rough estimate and other factors may be dominant.

**III** hard acids or bases: nonpolarizable acids or bases

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    small, charged, and have high LUMOs (for acids) and low HOMOs (for bases).
  </li>
  <li>
    a strong interaction between hard acids and bases are dominated by charge attraction.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        interaction between hard acids and bases tend to have a large gap between the
        HOMO and LUMO
      </li>
      <li>
        very similar to ionic bonding. (Ref. Figure 81)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**IV** soft acids or bases: polarizable acids or bases

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    large, uncharged, and have low LUMOs (for acids) and high HOMOs (for bases).
  </li>
  <li>
    a strong interaction between soft acids and bases are dominated by orbital interaction.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        interaction between soft acids and bases tend to have a small gap between the
        HOMO and LUMO
      </li>
      <li>
        very similar to covalent bonding. (Ref. Figure 81)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**V** Soft acids prefer soft bases, and hard acids prefer hard bases.

**VI** Qualitative analysis tests for what ions are present in a given solution

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Group 1 are cations that precipitate out in the presence of acid or chloride anion
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        soft acids such as $\textrm{Ag}^{+}$, $\textrm{Pb}^{2+}$, and $\textrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$
        will precipitate out, although $\textrm{Cl}^{-}$ is a marginally hard base.
        This is due to the sizes of the cations that lead to strong bonding
        within the crystal lattice (water is a hard base, and therefore these
        cations prefer to interact with chloride anion instead of water)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Group 2 are cations that precipitate out in the presence of $\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{S}$ in acidic conditions
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        borderline and (less) soft acids such as $\textrm{HgS}$, $\textrm{CdS}$, $\textrm{CuS}$, $\textrm{SnS}$, 
        $\textrm{As}_{2}\textrm{S}_{3}$, $\textrm{Sb}_{2}\textrm{S}_{3}$, $\textrm{Bi}_{2}\textrm{S}_{3}$
        will precipitate out ($\textrm{S}^{2-}$).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Group 3 are cations that precipitate out in the presence of $\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{S}$ in basic conditions
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        borderline acids such as $\textrm{MnS}$, $\textrm{FeS}$, $\textrm{CoS}$, $\textrm{NiS}$, $\textrm{ZnS}$,
        precipitate out. The basic conditions (forming hydroxide) will cause $\textrm{Al}(\textrm{OH})_{3}$ and $\textrm{Cr}(\textrm{OH})_{3}$
        to also precipitate out.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Group 4 are cations that precipitate out in the presence of carbonate anion (hard).
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        hard acids such as Group 2 metal cations ($\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$, $\textrm{Sr}^{2+}$, $\textrm{Ba}^{2+}$) precipitate out.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Group 5 are cations that do not precipitate at all. They are the hardest acids.
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to conduct quantitative analysis, you follow the order below to test for groups:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Group 1 - add $\textrm{HCl}$ (aq)
      </li>
      <li>
        Group 2 - add $\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{S}$ (aq)
      </li>
      <li>
        Group 3 - add $\textrm{NaOH}$ (aq)
      </li>
      <li>
        Group 4 - add $(\textrm{NH}_{4})_{2}\textrm{CO}_{3}$ (aq), or $\textrm{Na}_{2}\textrm{CO}_{3}$ (aq)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**VII** Solubility of certain species can also be roughly predicted through HSAB. For example, $\textrm{AgCl}$,
$\textrm{AgBr}$, $\textrm{AgI}$ are all extremely insoluble, but $\textrm{AgF}$ is soluble.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    As the Lewis base (halides) become softer as you go down the group, the interaction with
    the Lewis acid becomes stronger, and the compound therefore more insoluble.
  </li>
  <li>
    $\textrm{AgF}$ and $\textrm{AgCl}$ are white, but the silver halides become more yellow as you go down the
    group. This is because color depends on HOMO-LUMO differences; as the gap between
    the HOMO and LUMO become larger, it results in shorter wavelengths of light being absorbed.
  </li>
</ol>

**VIII** Many organic reactions can also be predicted with HSAB.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    A hard Lewis base such as $\textrm{OH}^{-}$ or butyllithium reagents will tend to react with hard
    Lewis acids
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        these reactions will be dominated by significant charge attraction
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    A soft Lewis base such as $\textrm{SH}^{-}$ or organocopper reagents will tend to react with soft
    Lewis acids
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        these reactions will be dominated by significant orbital interaction
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    reactions involving conjugate addition can be predicted through HSAB
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        For more detail, refer to my organic chemistry notes.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

## 7.5.2 Titrations

**IX** Titration is an analytical method to determine the concentration of a certain species.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    An acid-base titration involves the determination of concentration of an acid using a
    known concentration of base, or the reverse.
  </li>
  <li>
    A redox reaction involves the determination of concentration of a reducing agent using a
    known concentration of an oxidizing agent, or the reverse.
  </li>
</ol>

**X** Here are words that are commonly used throughout titrations:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    titrant: what is being added, or the reagent of the known concentration.
  </li>
  <li>
    analyte: what is being tested, or the reagent of the unknown concentration.
  </li>
  <li>
    analyte: what is being tested, or the reagent of the unknown concentration.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        for bases such as sodium hydroxide that slowly react with carbon dioxide, it must
        be standardized regularly to ensure the known concentration is accurate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Standardization is done by using primary standards. These are compounds with
        high purity, high stability, high molecular mass, and high solubility.
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            $\textrm{KHP}$ (for $\textrm{NaOH}$), $\textrm{Na}_{2}\textrm{CO}_{3}$ (for $\textrm{HCl}$), $\textrm{Na}_{2}\textrm{C}_{2}\textrm{O}_{4}$ (for $\textrm{KMnO}_{4}$)
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Secondary standards are the chemicals that has been standardized against a
        primary standard.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    equivalence point: when the quantity of added titrant is the exact amount necessary for
    stoichiometric reaction with the analyte
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        also known as the stoichiometric point
      </li>
      <li>
        equivalence points are a property of the chemical reaction taking place
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    end point: the abrupt change in the physical property of a solution
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        end points are a property of indicators
      </li>
      <li>
        indicators are weak acids that change color when they are deprotonated
      </li>
      <li>
        it requires slightly more titrant to reach the end point compared to the
        equivalence point, when $\textrm{pH} = \textrm{pK}_{a}$ (indicator)
      </li>
      <li>
        it is wise to choose an indicator that is $\pm 1 \, \textrm{pH}$ of the $\textrm{pH}$ at the stoichiometric point.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    direct titration: the addition of titrant to analyte until the reaction is complete
  </li>
  <li>
    back titration: addition of a known excess of one standard reagent to the analyte, and
    then titrate the excess reagent with a second standard reagent
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        used when the end point is clear than the end point of the direct titration
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

**XI** Some tips for acid-base titrations:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Utilize the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for titrations as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    When possible, avoid using molarity in titrations and use number of moles instead.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        make sure to keep track of changes in volume throughout the reaction!
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the volumes in concentrations for the
        acid and conjugate base can be cancelled out.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure to keep track of units. Keep in mind that dividing millimoles with millimoles
    results in the same answer as dividing moles with moles. Same for milliliters.
  </li>
  <li>
    for the titration of a weak acid, at half the volume of its equivalence point, this is the
    maximum buffer region, where $[\textrm{A}^{-}] = [\textrm{HA}]$ and $\textrm{pH} = \textrm{pK}_{a}$
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        very useful to determine the $\textrm{pK}_{a}$ of a weak unknown acid
      </li>
      <li>
        for polyprotic acids, you will observe multiple stoichiometric points and multiple
        buffer regions.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
