**I** Solubility product ($\textrm{K}_{sp}$): the equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between an ionic solid and
its ions

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    determines the extent of solubility for a certain ionic compound. For example, $\textrm{PbS}$ is:
    
    $\textrm{PbS}(\textrm{s}) \leftrightharpoons \textrm{Pb}^{2+}(\textrm{aq}) + \textrm{S}^{2-}(\textrm{aq})$
    $\textrm{K}_{sp} = [\textrm{Pb}^{2+}][\textrm{S}^{2-}]$
  </li>
  <li>
    note that these equilibria are only meaningful for sparingly soluble salts as:
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        ionic solids with strong ionic interactions exist as ion pairs even in water
      </li>
      <li>
        these ionic solids may form clusters in water, not being separated in water
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    calculating the molar solubility of a salt is convenient with $\textrm{K}_{sp}$.
  </li>
</ol>

**II** common-ion effect: the decrease in solubility due to the addition of an ion present in the salt

<ol type="a">
  <li>A consequence of the Le Chatelier's principle</li>
  <li>
    difficult to predict the common-ion effect accurately due to strong ion-ion
    interaction
  </li>
</ol>

**III** $\textrm{Q}_{sp}$ (reaction quotient) allows you to predict whether mixing two ions will form a precipitate:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    When $\textrm{Q}_{sp}$ is larger than $\textrm{K}_{sp}$, the salt will
    precipitate.
  </li>
  <li>
    When $\textrm{Q}_{sp}$ is less than $\textrm{K}_{sp}$, the salt will
    dissolve.
  </li>
</ol>
