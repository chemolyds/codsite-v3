# Grading Scheme

The score is based off of two variables: time and accuracy.
The time makes up 20% of the overall score, with accuracy the other 80%.
The formula can be written as follows:

$$
S = 0.20 \cdot f(t) + 0.80 \cdot P
$$

Where $S$ is score, $f(t)$ is points from time, and $P$ is points from the exam, all in percent.

## Time

The score in time is a piecewise function, meant to allot full points to those who use half the max time or less.
Afterwards, it linearly decreases until it hits zero points at the max time.
The formula is shown as follows:

$$
f(x) =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
			1 																															& \quad t \leq \dfrac{t_{MAX}}{2} \\
			1 + \dfrac{t - 0.5 \cdot t_{MAX}}{0.5 \cdot t_{MAX} - t_{MAX}} 	& \quad t \geq \dfrac{t_{MAX}}{2}
	\end{array}
\right.
$$

Where $t_{MAX}$ is the maximum time alloted for the exam.
This ensures that "rushing" the exam will award no extra points compared to spending half the alloted time.

### Examples

There's not a lot of cases to cover for this, but I will give a couple examples.
Assume that the exam is 60 minutes long, meaning you get full credit if you turn it in within 30 minutes.

- Someone submitted the exam after a minute (somehow): 100%
- Someone submitted the exam in 30 minutes: 100%
- Someone submitted the exam in 31 minutes: 96.67%
- Someone submitted the exam in 59 minutes: 3.33%
