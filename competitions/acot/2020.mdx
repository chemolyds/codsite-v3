# ACOT '20

---

The first ACOT was a different format than the later years. The early rounds were a free-response style competition, in which participants were eliminated according to how well they placed relative to others. The later rounds were a 1v1 style competition, in which participants were given a short amount of time to solve various free-response questions. Competitors were placed in brackets depending on their scores.
