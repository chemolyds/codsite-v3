# ACOT '20
---
We had 29 individuals competing in ACOT. The competition was held on **September 27th, 2020 and November 21~22nd**. This was a completely original competition proposed by Kwanwoo "Fizzest" Park and was written by our Contest Curator Team (Alec "apc1234567" Zhu, Stabell, Maestron, and Fizzest). This competition was divided into two dates due to lack of staff.

The early rounds were a free-response style competition. Participants were eliminated into the according to how well they placed relative to others.

The later rounds were a 1v1 style competition, in which participants were given a short amount of time to solve various free-response questions. Competitors were placed in brackets depending on their score in the early rounds.
