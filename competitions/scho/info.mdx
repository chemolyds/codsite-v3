<center><i>The Summer Chemistry Olympiad (SChO) is a competition for everybody, from individuals just getting started to those at the highest level of competition.</i></center>

# What is SChO?

SChO will be the **first** competition that applies our new proposed **tier system** into our competitions. **Only in the 2021 competition** will you be able to _choose_ which tier seems appropriate to your skill level. At the end of this competition, participants may choose to either stay, move down, or move up a tier depending on how well they compete. In future CODS competitions, however, all participants (with the exception of Campers and IChO Participants) will begin at Bronze tier and progress normally.

If you would like to read more about our tier system and syllabus for each tier, please refer to our [Competitor's Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1sRpdIc8lQ6bDVwBZAEUeXERhaSUqx836beWHGYjOoC0/edit).

## Bronze Tier

Bronze tier is aimed at participants who have finished their first year of undergraduate chemistry and are just getting started into competitive chemistry.

> **Note:** _A-level_ _chemistry,_ _AP Chemistry, and equivalent will suffice._

Students will be given **two hours** to solve four IChO-styled free-response questions. Each question will deal with an unique topic in chemistry and will have optional hints, often given in the form of a formula or a knowledge refresher. While the concepts involved will be very limited (we will avoid testing your knowledge on chemistry trivia or advanced topics), participants will still be expected to know how to apply the basic concepts into challenging problems.

## Silver Tier

Silver tier is aimed for individuals who can compete at their national level, and will be slightly more difficult than [WCC Part II](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xur33-cZHQVfyTktxRlEL30JOxk8TgOQ/view?usp=sharing).

Participants will be given **3.5 hours** to solve **seven IChO-styled free-response questions**. Unlike the Bronze tier, the Silver tier and Gold tier competitions will not have any optional hints.

## Gold Tier

The Gold tier is for participants who are skilled enough to make their national camp, or even qualify for IChO. The level of difficulty is very similar to our [CODSChO exam last year](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q2C9_hC0KWsQCxMxh4it4rpahQGDcFC0/view?usp=sharing), which is between IChO and Mendeleev difficulty.

Participants will be given **five hours** to solve **nine IChO-styled questions**.

# Proctoring and Privacy

For SChO, we expect **all participants to undergo video proctoring** in order to tighten security measures. In the case you cannot undergo video proctoring, please request an appeal at [chemolyds@gmail.com](mailto:chemolyds@gmail.com).

## Video Proctoring

Video proctoring will require two devices, or one device with a detachable webcam or recording device.

- Make sure your video device is fully charged or connected to a power cable. Devices must remain powered during the entire exam.
- Please test that your webcam functions properly.
- Have a fixed camera angle to cover the whole working space, including the following:

- the screen of the PC/laptop that is being used to take the exam
- the body and hands of the students (you are permitted to wear a mask if you&#39;d like to keep your facial identity hidden)
- the working area of the desk as shown below.

- Please have all of your devices in airplane mode with WIFI on or in DND mode.
- Please ensure that your recording device records **your hands, your workspace, and your monitor**.
