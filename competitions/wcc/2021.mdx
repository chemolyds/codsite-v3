# WCC '21

---

This competition is the first version of what ended up being SOCC.
The Spring Open Chemistry Competition (SOCC) is a mock USNCO. It does not sport our tier system, but instead has a single difficulty that is slightly harder than the predicted USCNO exam.

The scores can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lW2ISGFaHxL9CR5t_mfwLxb5dfyzjcwD/view?usp=sharing).
