# CODSCT '20
---
We had 14 teams (74 individuals) competing in CODSCT for the 2020 Season. The competition was held in **April 4th and 5th, 2020** as a direct replacement of WUCT, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

This competition, as a direct replacement (but much harder) of WUCT, was first proposed by Alec "apc1234567" Zhu, with significant contributions made by the 2020 USA IChO team (Anugrah "llamachemist" Chemparathy, Anathan Sadagopan, Nick Tsao).
